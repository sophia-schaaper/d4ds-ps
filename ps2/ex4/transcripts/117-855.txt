                      WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 2021

                              United States Senate,
                                Committee on the Judiciary,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m., in Room 
226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Richard J. Durbin, 
Chair of the Committee, presiding.
    Present: Senators Durbin [presiding], Feinstein, 
Whitehouse, Klobuchar, Blumenthal, Hirono, Booker, Padilla, 
Ossoff, Grassley, Lee, Cruz, Hawley, Kennedy, Tillis, and 
Blackburn.
    Also present: Senators Shaheen, Hassan, Heinrich, and 
Lujan.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD J. DURBIN,

           A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS

    Chair Durbin. The hearing will come to order. Today we hear 
from six outstanding nominees to the Federal bench: Judge 
Gabriel Sanchez, nominated to the Ninth Circuit; Samantha 
Elliott, nominated to the District of New Hampshire; Judge 
Linda Lopez, nominated to the Southern District of California; 
Judge Katherine Menendez, nominated to the District of 
Minnesota; Judge Jinsook Ohta, also nominated to the Southern 
District of California; and David Urias--I hope I pronounced 
that correctly--nominated to the District of New Mexico.
    Today&#x27;s slate represents a continued effort by the Biden 
administration and Senate Democrats to advance nominees with 
the very best credentials who also bring professional and 
demographic diversity to our Federal courts. It&#x27;s an impressive 
group before us today. We have four sitting judges with strong 
records of judicial independence and an evenhanded approach to 
justice. Two nominees spent a large portion of their careers as 
Federal Public Defenders, offering a perspective too often 
missing from the bench. These individuals also have significant 
experience in litigating in Federal court.
    In addition to their experiential diversity, this slate 
includes demographic diversity. Judge Lopez would be the only 
active Latina judge on the U.S. District Court for the Southern 
District of California, and Judge Ohta would be the first AAPI 
woman to ever sit on that court.
    A number of our colleagues today are here to introduce 
nominees, and I look forward to hearing from them, but first I 
turn to my Ranking Member, Chuck Grassley.

         OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CHARLES E. GRASSLEY,

             A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF IOWA

    Senator Grassley. Mr. Chairman, I&#x27;m going to start out with 
something that I read, that you had said something about the 
blue slip process. If I&#x27;m wrong on this, I&#x27;ll stand corrected 
after I make my statement. I welcome any response you want to 
give me.
    Chairman Durbin said that he was considering getting rid of 
the district court blue slips for nominees if the objection was 
not based on the merits of the judge. Instead, there might be a 
number of exceptions for if a Senator declined to return a blue 
slip because a nominee was a woman, because of sexual 
orientation, or something similar.
    I think questioning our colleagues&#x27; motives would be a 
terrible mistake. Democrats refused to return--[sound of 
ringtone]--well, I thought we turned--get that out of here, 
will you? I turned my telephone off, so I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s 
going through my iPad, but it is. You got it turned off?
    Chair Durbin. Okay, throw it in a bucket of water.
    Senator Grassley. Okay. If you&#x27;ll forgive me, I&#x27;m going to 
start over again.
    Chair Durbin. You&#x27;re going to say all that again?
    Senator Grassley. What?
    Chair Durbin. Go right ahead.
    Senator Grassley. Okay. Before we get to questioning, I&#x27;d 
like to talk about a news report that I recently saw. At an 
interview, Chairman Durbin said that he was considering getting 
rid of the district court blue slips for nominees if the 
objection was not based on the merits of the judge. Instead, 
there might be a number of exceptions for if a Senator declined 
to return a blue slip because the nominee might be a woman, 
because of sexual orientation, or something similar.
    I think questioning our colleagues&#x27; motives would be a 
terrible mistake. Democrats refused to return blue slips for 
qualified employees. For example, the Senator from New Mexico 
declined to return blue slip for three nominees. We didn&#x27;t 
disregard their blue slips. For another nominee, the Committee 
also did not receive a blue slip, and some thought that it was 
because he expressed his religious beliefs. Catholic bishops 
even wrote a letter expressing concern, but we didn&#x27;t disregard 
the blue slip. California Senators also declined to return blue 
slips for many nominees. Here are just a few: Jeremy Rosen, 
Sandy Leal, Adam Braverman, Michelle Pettit. The group of the 
nominees included long-time prosecutors, veterans, and a judge.
    They were all highly qualified, and none of these received 
a hearing because of our respect for the blue slip process. 
This would be a very enormous change. It would break down into 
questioning the motivations of our colleagues, and I don&#x27;t 
think that the Committee should ever take that step.
    As for the nominees today, I compliment them for being here 
and wait for the opportunity to ask you a few questions.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks----
    Senator Grassley. You can tell me whether I&#x27;m right or 
wrong.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Senator Grassley. For those who are 
not aware, the blue slip is the privilege given to Senators 
from the State where the district court is named to decide 
whether that nomination goes forward. It&#x27;s an up-or-down 
decision, and historically it has been honored, with very few 
exceptions, but there have been instances where nominees were 
rejected, who were clearly well-qualified for the bench, for 
various reasons. It is rare, it is extraordinary, but it 
happens.
    I hope it doesn&#x27;t happen during this two-year period, and I 
hope that we can find common ground. I am encouraged. Senator 
Tillis just the other day supported nominees for the District 
Court in North Carolina that had been agreed to by a Democratic 
committee, and Senator Burr supported them as well. That kind 
of bipartisanship is what I&#x27;m looking for.
    What I want to try to avoid is, in some States, 
discrimination against people that is just very blatant and 
obvious. It would be in the extreme that I would make any 
exception to this, and I agree with you completely. Deciding 
what the motive of an individual Senator is, in a case, is a 
challenge I hope I never have to face. I think if we continue 
to work in a bipartisan fashion, as North Carolina 
demonstrated, that we are going to be able to meet our 
responsibilities.
    At this point----
    Senator Feinstein. I would like to make a statement.
    Chair Durbin. Sure. Senator Feinstein, please.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DIANNE FEINSTEIN,

          A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

    Senator Feinstein. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I 
want to speak today because the three nominees on the Federal 
courts are from California. Gabriel Sanchez has been nominated 
to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth. 
Linda Lopez and Jinsook Ohta have been nominated to serve on 
the District Court for the Southern District of California. I 
want to point out that these three nominees are highly 
qualified. They are experienced, and they are talented, and I 
believe they will make excellent additions to our Federal 
courts.
    First, let me just speak for a moment about Gabriel 
Sanchez. He is currently an associate justice on the California 
Court of Appeals. He received his undergraduate degree from 
Yale, a master&#x27;s degree from Cambridge, and his law degree from 
Yale Law School. After law school, Justice Sanchez served as a 
law clerk for Judge Richard Paez of the Ninth Circuit. I&#x27;m sure 
that Judge Paez is thrilled that his former law clerk may soon 
be joining him as a colleague on the bench.
    Justice Sanchez spent several years in private practice 
before joining the California attorney general&#x27;s office. He 
then went on to serve as deputy legal affairs secretary for 
California Governor Jerry Brown. Governor Brown nominated 
Justice Sanchez to the California Court of Appeal for the First 
Appellate District in 2018. Since then, he has established a 
record of excellence as an appellate judge. That experience, we 
believe, will serve him well on the Ninth.
    I&#x27;m also pleased that the Committee is considering two 
qualified nominees, Mr. Chairman, to serve as district court 
judges from the Southern District of California, Linda Lopez 
and Jinsook Ohta. Linda Lopez currently serves as a magistrate 
judge in the Southern District of California, and she is joined 
today by her husband, Victor, and three of her law clerks.
    Judge Lopez is the daughter of immigrants from Cuba. She 
was raised in Florida. She received her undergraduate degree 
from Florida International University and her law degree from 
the University of Miami School of Law. She spent several years 
working in private practice in Florida before moving to San 
Diego. In 2007, she joined the Federal Defenders of San Diego, 
where she spent 11 years as a Federal Public Defender 
representing low-income clients.
    Finally, Jinsook Ohta currently serves as a California 
Superior Court judge in San Diego. Judge Ohta immigrated to the 
United States at the age of six, along with her parents, Jung 
Soon Lee and Tae Won Lee, both of whom are here with her today.
    These are both very qualified nominees, and I&#x27;m just 
delighted that they&#x27;re before this Committee this morning, and 
I believe the Committee will receive them well. Thank you very 
much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Senator Feinstein. Senator Padilla, 
would you like to speak at this point?
    Senator Padilla. Yes sir.

            OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ALEX PADILLA,

          A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

    Senator Padilla. Thank you, Mr. Chair and Ranking Member 
Grassley. It&#x27;s my honor to also help introduce the three 
outstanding and highly qualified nominees from the State of 
California and welcome them and their loved ones to the Senate 
Judiciary Committee.
    Justice Gabriel Sanchez is here today with his wife, 
Christina; his son Conrad; his mother, Carmen; and other loved 
ones. Justice Sanchez is a--is highly respected in California, 
and he brings thoughtfulness and empathy to every decision that 
he makes. He was born and raised in Los Angeles, as was I, 
proud son of a single mother from Mexico who worked tirelessly 
to make ends meet. With her love and support, Justice Sanchez 
went on to earn degrees from Yale College, Cambridge 
University, and Yale Law School.
    He then began his legal career as a law clerk to Judge 
Richard Paez on the Ninth Circuit, the same court where he is 
now nominated to serve. Justice Sanchez then went into private 
practice, as many young lawyers do, but committed himself to 
engaging deeply in providing pro bono legal services. 
Admirably, he earned a social justice award from the ACLU of 
Southern California for his work representing farmworkers, a 
cause that many, if not all, the Members of this Committee can 
appreciate, in a lawsuit to enforce heat illness workplace 
safety protections, that was the subject of his actions there.
    Justice Sanchez went on to serve with distinction in 
California State government, both as a deputy attorney general 
and then as a deputy legal affairs secretary for Governor Jerry 
Brown, where he proved himself to be a sharp thinker, a create 
problem solver, and a dedicated public servant. In recognition 
of his work and his evenhanded judgments, Governor Brown 
appointed Justice Sanchez to the California Court of Appeals in 
2018. He&#x27;s earned a reputation as a thoughtful jurist, 
committed to justice for all, and I&#x27;m confident he&#x27;ll bring the 
same dedication to the bench on the Ninth Circuit.
    We also have Judge Jinsook Ohta, who is joined by her 
husband, Jason; her parents; and her sister and other close 
friends. At the age of six, Judge Ohta immigrated with her 
family from South Korea to the United States. She has lived the 
immigrant experience and what we refer to as the American 
dream. Through her hard work and dedication, Judge Ohta went on 
to graduate from Yale College and the New York University 
School of Law.
    She began her career as a law clerk to Judge Barry 
Moskowitz, a judge on the Southern District of California, the 
same judge whose seat she is now nominated to fill. Judge Ohta 
spent nearly 10 years of her career serving in the California 
attorney general&#x27;s office, where she helped to prosecute unfair 
business practices and protect consumers from fraud. She was 
known for her dedicated mentorship of younger attorneys, as 
well as her advocacy for women in the law.
    In 2020, Judge Ohta was appointed to the San Diego Superior 
Court by Governor Gavin Newsom, and as a family judge, she 
presides with compassion over some of the most difficult and 
sensitive matters that come before any court. Judge Ohta&#x27;s 
empathy is matched by her stellar legal qualifications, and the 
Southern District will benefit from her service.
    Finally, Judge Linda Lopez is here, along with her husband, 
Victor; her son, Angel; and three of her law clerks. Yes, she&#x27;s 
originally from Florida, having attended Miami-Dade Community 
College, Florida International University, and the University 
of Miami School of Law. After graduating and working in private 
practice for several years, she saw the light and made her way 
to California in 2007, and began her tireless service as a 
Federal Public Defender.
    Judge Lopez spent more than 10 years as a Senior Trial 
Attorney for the Federal Defenders of San Diego, where she 
helped to uphold our constitutional commitment that every 
person deserves fair representation, especially when facing the 
prosecutorial power of the State. She&#x27;s earned recognition from 
the Southern District of California for her outstanding 
community service and, in 2018, was appointed to serve as a 
Federal Magistrate Judge. Through her work, Judge Lopez 
demonstrates her legal acumen and commitment to fairness each 
and every day. In a testament to that fact, she has earned 
endorsements for her nomination from both Federal prosecutors 
and defenders.
    As a long-time public defender, Judge Lopez brings a 
professional background that has too often been missing from 
our judicial branch, but her perspective, her commitment to 
equal justice for all will strengthen the Southern District&#x27;s 
bench. Colleagues, I urge you to swiftly confirm all three of 
these highly qualified nominees. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Padilla. Before turning to 
our visiting Senate dignitaries, we will recognize Senator 
Klobuchar to introduce Judge Menendez.
    Senator Klobuchar. You know, actually, I&#x27;ll let my 
colleagues go first. I&#x27;m fine.
    Chair Durbin. That&#x27;s very kind.
    Senator Klobuchar. They&#x27;re here visiting. We must be kind 
to our visitors.
    Chair Durbin. What an example you&#x27;ve set. We&#x27;re honored to 
have the Granite State&#x27;s entire Senate delegation here, two 
former Governors. We&#x27;ll start with Senator Shaheen.

               STATEMENT OF HON. JEANNE SHAHEEN,

         A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE

    Senator Shaheen. Thank you very much, Chairman Durbin, and 
thank you, Senator Klobuchar, for allowing us to go before you, 
and Ranking Member Grassley. I appreciate being before the 
Committee today, and I&#x27;m really honored to be here with my 
colleague, Senator Hassan, to introduce Samantha Elliott, who 
is the nominee to serve on the District Court for the District 
of New Hampshire. She&#x27;s joined today by her husband, Matt, and 
her son Henry, and we welcome them, as well. I know that lots 
of folks are watching and supporting her this morning.
    Samantha Elliott is eminently qualified to serve as--on the 
District Court in New Hampshire. She graduated from Columbia 
University School of Law, and she&#x27;s currently an attorney at 
the Gallagher, Callahan &amp; Gartrell law firm in our capital 
city, Concord. Samantha Elliott has litigated before Federal 
and State courts, handling an impressive collection of matters 
that involve complex areas of the law. Her work has earned her 
recognition by the legal community and her peers as one of the 
top-performing attorneys in her practice areas.
    Not only has Samantha excelled in her practice, but she&#x27;s 
dedicated her time and efforts to the New Hampshire legal aid 
community. For nine years she served on the joint board of New 
Hampshire Legal Assistance and the Legal Advice and Referral 
Center, and she&#x27;s held various roles on its executive 
committee. In their letter of support for Samantha&#x27;s 
nomination, Deborah Kane Rein and John Tobin, colleagues of 
Samantha&#x27;s in New Hampshire who worked with her on these Legal 
Assistance positions, spoke glowingly of her commitment to 
ensuring that everyone has access to justice, no matter their 
socioeconomic status. They described her efforts for the legal 
aid community in New Hampshire as immeasurable and marveled at 
her ability to devote so much time to legal aid while excelling 
in her private practice. Samantha&#x27;s tireless dedication to 
legal aid and exceptional representation in private practice 
demonstrate her commitment to the principle of equal justice 
under the law and her skill as a legal practitioner.
    Her nomination is supported not just by those who know her 
work on legal aid issues but by a diverse collection of 
attorneys and others in the New Hampshire legal community. One 
of my favorite letters of support came from Chuck Douglas, who 
is a former Republican representative to Congress and New 
Hampshire Supreme Court justice. He&#x27;s only ever faced Samantha 
as an adversary in litigation, but he said, and I quote, ``She 
is an excellent lawyer who is creative and diligent and 
exhibits the highest standards of our profession.&#x27;&#x27; Mr. 
Chairman, I am confident that Samantha Elliott&#x27;s passion for 
the law and dedication to the impartial administration of 
justice would make her an excellent judge. Thank you again for 
allowing me to appear before the Committee today, and I look 
forward to supporting her nomination when it comes to the 
floor.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Senator Shaheen. Senator Hassan.

               STATEMENT OF HON. MARGARET HASSAN,

         A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE

    Senator Hassan. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I want to thank 
you and the Ranking Member for the courtesy of welcoming us 
here, and thank you, Senator Klobuchar, for allowing us to go 
before you. It&#x27;s always a real honor to be with my senior 
senator, Senator Shaheen.
    It&#x27;s also a real honor to be here today to join in 
introducing Samantha Elliott of Concord as the Committee 
considers her nomination to serve on the U.S. District Court 
for the District of New Hampshire. I also want to take a moment 
to thank Ms. Elliott&#x27;s family, including her husband, Matt, and 
her son Henry, for being here today; her daughter and mother, 
who are unable to join us but I&#x27;m sure are watching; and she&#x27;s 
also got a lot of extended family here today who I had the 
pleasure of meeting. Thanks to her family for supporting her in 
her work and in this nomination process.
    Ms. Elliott is an exceptionally qualified candidate to 
serve in this role. She will bring years of dedicated 
experience representing Granite Staters, as well as a passion 
for justice, to the Federal bench if she is confirmed. Ms. 
Elliott has been a leader within the New Hampshire legal 
community and in our small, tightly knit bar, where people 
really get to know each other. The support and respect that she 
has is deep, and it is palpable.
    As Senator Shaheen shared, throughout Ms. Elliott&#x27;s legal 
practice she has represented clients at every level of New 
Hampshire State court, the U.S. District Court for the District 
of New Hampshire, and the First Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Through her work, she has shown a commitment to excellence. 
She&#x27;s been selected for inclusion in The Best Lawyers in 
America as well as New England Super Lawyers, which are earned 
as a result of respect and admiration among her peers in the 
legal field.
    But even beyond Ms. Elliott&#x27;s distinct and numerous 
accomplishments, it is impressive to see the extent to which 
she has used her professional experience to give back to her 
community and to her State through the New Hampshire Legal 
Assistance and Legal Advice Referral Center, which is dedicated 
to providing legal services to low-income Granite Staters. This 
year, she became co-chair of the founding board of directors 
for 603 Legal Aid, another critical resource and legal support 
system for those in need in our State.
    Through these dedicated efforts, Ms. Elliott has 
demonstrated a belief that all people deserve access to equal 
justice, and her work has helped provide vulnerable individuals 
in our State with opportunities to receive high quality legal 
aid. Just yesterday, the American Bar Association announced 
that the members of its standing committee unanimously found 
Ms. Elliott to be ``well qualified&#x27;&#x27; for this role, the ABA&#x27;s 
highest rating, based on her integrity, professional 
competence, and judicial temperament.
    I am likewise confident that Samantha Elliott will be a 
fair-minded, balanced, and intellectually curious judge with a 
deep commitment to justice, and she will serve Granite Staters 
with distinction on the U.S. District Court for the District of 
New Hampshire. I urge the Committee to look favorably upon her 
nomination, and I look forward to voting for her confirmation 
when it comes to the floor. Thank you again for allowing me to 
be part of this process.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Hassan. Senator Klobuchar, 
you&#x27;re next up, but you can defer again.
    Senator Klobuchar. I will again defer. It&#x27;s wonderful 
hearing about these judges.
    Chair Durbin. Well----
    Senator Klobuchar. Go ahead.
    Chair Durbin [continuing]. Let us turn to Senator 
Heinrich--I believe you were next in line--from New Mexico.

               STATEMENT OF HON. MARTIN HEINRICH,

          A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW MEXICO

    Senator Heinrich. Thank you, Chairman Durbin, Ranking 
Member Grassley, distinguished Members of this Committee. It is 
my honor to introduce to you today David Herrera Urias, 
President Biden&#x27;s nominee for a vacant seat on the U.S. 
District Court of New Mexico.
    Mr. Urias was born in West Texas, but even I will not hold 
that against him. He was raised and has lived most of his life 
in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where this district court seat will 
be based. He attended public schools, from elementary to high 
school, on Albuquerque&#x27;s West Side before going to college at 
the University of New Mexico. Mr. Urias learned the virtues of 
hard work and honesty from his father, David Sr., who worked 
for years at a local tire store, and his mother, Estella, who 
worked at a leather goods factory. His father passed away in 
2003, after a long battle with cancer, but Estella still lives 
in Albuquerque in the house where she and her husband raised 
their family.
    When he was 19 years old and working as a busboy at a local 
restaurant, Mr. Urias met his future wife, Yolanda. They will 
celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary next spring. I would 
like to quickly acknowledge Yolanda and their five boys, 
Cristobal, Gabriel, Tomas, Estevan, and Elias, who I am sure 
are so proud to celebrate his nomination. I was proud to join 
my colleague, Senator Lujan, in strongly recommending Mr. Urias 
for this judicial nomination.
    Over the course of his legal career, he has built an 
impressive reputation as he has successfully litigated cases 
before both State and Federal courts. After graduating from the 
University of New Mexico Law School, Mr. Urias served as a 
judicial clerk to Hon. Vanessa Ruiz of the District of Columbia 
Court of Appeals. He then joined the firm Fried, Frank, Harris, 
Shriver &amp; Jacobson, in New York City, where he practiced 
corporate and commercial litigation. He also had the privilege 
of representing families of the victims of the September 11th 
terrorist attacks. After gaining that valuable experience, Mr. 
Urias became a staff attorney for the Mexican American Legal 
Defense and Educational Fund, one of the largest and most 
prominent Latino legal organizations in our Nation.
    At MALDEF, Mr. Urias practiced cases throughout the 
Southwest and conducted multiple trials before Federal courts. 
In 2008, he returned home to New Mexico to practice law at the 
law firm now known as Freedman, Boyd, Hollander, Goldberg, 
Urias &amp; Ward. Since 2018, he has been the president of the 
firm, which handles class action law, civil rights law, 
criminal defense, and complex civil litigation.
    Throughout his career, Mr. Urias has served as a mentor and 
role model for countless junior attorneys, has been an active 
member of the UNM Law School community, and provided pro bono 
representation for the most vulnerable in our communities. I am 
confident that he will continue to--a proud legacy of 
compassionate and committed Federal judges in the State of New 
Mexico. The broad bipartisan letters of support that this 
Committee has received in support of his nomination share that 
same confidence, and I would encourage all the Members of this 
Committee to support his nomination. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator. Senator Lujan.

                STATEMENT OF HON. BEN RAY LUJAN,

          A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW MEXICO

    Senator Lujan. Chairman Durbin, thank you so very much. 
Ranking Member Grassley, it&#x27;s an honor to be with you and 
Members of the Committee--and, again, I want to thank Senator 
Klobuchar for her graciousness in allowing us to be able to 
proceed--to be here with our senior Senator from New Mexico, 
Martin Heinrich, and standing alongside the family of David 
Urias to serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of 
New Mexico. Building on the confirmation of Margaret Strickland 
to the court, the District of New Mexico needs more judges who 
represent New Mexico and all we have to offer. Mr. Urias is 
that judge, and I was proud to join Senator Heinrich in 
recommending him for this position.
    David&#x27;s commitment, experience, and New Mexico roots make 
him a superb nominee for this vacancy. Importantly, his 
nomination and eventual confirmation will help ensure the 
judiciary looks like our State. A public school student, son of 
working class parents, Mr. Urias represents the lived 
experiences of New Mexicans who work hard, achieve success, and 
apply that dedication to serving others. As an Albuquerque 
resident, Mr. Urias was born in the West Texas area and made 
his way to New Mexico at a young age. He received his BA from 
the University of New Mexico, JD from University of New Mexico 
School of Law, and Mr. Urias then clerked for Judge Vanessa 
Ruiz on the DC Court of Appeals and worked as an associate at 
Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson in New York City. 
Following his clerkship, he received the prestigious Fried 
Frank Civil Rights Fellowship, an incredible achievement, but 
he quickly returned to New Mexico to commit himself to serving 
others.
    David&#x27;s entire career has centered on giving back to the 
community, representing the diversity of who we are, and 
advocating for others. Mr. Urias has served as a mentor of new 
generations of legal minds and hasn&#x27;t let the cost of legal 
services stop him from representing those who need 
representation the most. His family&#x27;s support and commitment, 
sitting alongside him today, I think represents the very best 
of America.
    President Biden said from day one that he would commit to 
nominating more qualified and diverse candidates to the courts, 
so that our judicial system begins to reflect the tapestry of 
America. Mr. Urias&#x27;s nomination means so much to countless New 
Mexicans back home, to me, and to Senator Heinrich. Mr. Urias 
is a highly qualified nominee, and it&#x27;s my honor to stand with 
him today to request and urge for a swift vote for his 
confirmation, and I look forward to supporting Mr. Urias when 
this gets to the Senate floor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you very much, Senator Lujan. Now, what 
America&#x27;s been waiting for, Senator Klobuchar to speak to Judge 
Menendez.
    Senator Klobuchar. They&#x27;ve been actually waiting for the 
good news about my introduction about Judge Kate Menendez.

            OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR,

           A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MINNESOTA

    Senator Klobuchar. I want to thank you, Senator Durbin, and 
you, Senator Grassley, for holding this hearing today. Judge 
Kate Menendez, who&#x27;s a Federal magistrate, is the President&#x27;s 
nominee to become a Federal district judge for the District of 
Minnesota. She&#x27;s supported by both Senator Tina Smith, who had 
another hearing today, and myself. Judge Menendez is here with 
her husband, Dan, and her two sons, Riley and Finn. Watching on 
TV is her mom, Susan, and her brother, Adam, all of whom, I 
know, are cheering her on.
    Judge Menendez is a dedicated public servant with a 
distinguished career spanning over two decades of service. She 
currently serves, as I noted, as a U.S. magistrate judge for 
the District of Minnesota, a position she&#x27;s held since 2016. 
She has earned a reputation for being a fair-minded, 
insightful, and efficient magistrate that consistently applies 
precedent of the Federal district court, Eighth Circuit, and 
the U.S. Supreme Court. She has presided over hundreds of cases 
spanning a wide range of civil and criminal matters, and her 
orders and decisions have been adopted by the judges of the 
Minnesota Federal district court, a court which includes judges 
nominated by Presidents Ford, Reagan, Clinton, Bush, Obama, and 
Trump, and they have upheld her decisions approximately 97 
percent of the time. In other words, she is ready to serve as a 
Federal district court judge on her very first day on the job.
    She also will bring to the bench her lifelong dedication to 
public service. Judge Menendez was born in Emporia, Kansas and 
attended Topeka High School. After graduating, she attended the 
University of Chicago--that was for you, Senator Durbin--where 
she graduated with honors. Even in college, she demonstrated a 
commitment to public service. When she wasn&#x27;t working as a 
waitress in Hyde Park, she volunteered her time at a women&#x27;s 
shelter. She also co-founded an organization dedicated to 
working with the homeless and was recognized for her work by 
the University of Chicago, where she was awarded the 
President&#x27;s Award for Volunteer Service. She then went to law 
school, where she served as an editor on one of the law 
school&#x27;s journals and graduated magna cum laude.
    After clerking on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, she 
began her legal career in public service in Minnesota, working 
for nearly 20 years representing those who could not afford 
counsel. During that time, Judge Menendez served as lead 
counsel or sole counsel in hundreds of district court hearings, 
argued before the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, and appeared 
before the U.S. Supreme Court not once, but twice in her role 
as Assistant Federal Defender, winning over--this is for you, 
Senator Grassley--winning over Justice Scalia, who wrote the 8-
1 decision in favor of Judge Menendez&#x27;s client.
    In addition to her work in the courtroom, Judge Menendez 
also served as an adjunct professor of law at the University of 
Minnesota Law School, Hamline University School of Law, and St. 
Thomas. After she was named Minnesota Lawyer of the Year in 
2015, the Federal judges on the Minnesota District Court, 
nominated by both Republican and Democratic presidents, 
selected her as magistrate. She comes highly recommended to 
this Committee, initially recommended by a judicial selection 
committee that I convened with Senator Smith, consisting of 
Minnesota attorneys and judges, and I know that Judge Menendez 
has support from judges on the Minnesota District Court as well 
as several on the Eighth Circuit.
    The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary 
unanimously rated Judge Menendez as ``well qualified&#x27;&#x27;, the 
highest rating that the committee awards, and based on the 
review of her professional competence, integrity, and judicial 
temperament, I believe she&#x27;ll make an outstanding Federal 
district court judge for the District of Minnesota, and I urge 
for her swift confirmation. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. As you 
mentioned, your colleague Senator Tina Smith has, 
unfortunately, a conflict at this time, but she is going to 
submit a statement for the record in support of Judge Menendez, 
as well.
    We have one circuit judge nominee, and the others are 
district court judge nominees. The tradition of the Committee 
is to take the circuit court nominee first, and that would be 
Judge Sanchez. Judge, if you would come forward, please? Before 
you sit down, I&#x27;m going to swear you in with the traditional 
oath, if you&#x27;d raise your right hand.
    [Witness was sworn in.]
    Let the record indicate that the Judge answered in the 
affirmative, as we had hoped. Judge Sanchez, now please take a 
seat and push the button on the console in front of you so that 
we can all hear you, and the floor is yours.

                STATEMENT OF GABRIEL P. SANCHEZ,

             NOMINATED TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT

                  JUDGE FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

    Judge Sanchez. Thank you, Chairman Durbin. I would like to 
thank you and Ranking Member Grassley for convening this 
hearing and all the Members of this Committee for considering 
my nomination. I&#x27;m deeply grateful to Senators Feinstein and 
Padilla for their generous introductory remarks. I would like 
to thank President Biden for the incredible honor of this 
nomination.
    I do not have introductory remarks, but I am proud to 
introduce my family, sitting behind me. First, my mother, 
Carmen Sanchez. I grew up as an only child to a single mother 
in Los Angeles, and although we had few means, she was 
relentless in her pursuit of scholarships and educational 
opportunities for me. I would not be here today if not for her 
love and sacrifice.
    My aunt, Martha Sanchez-Werner, one of the first women to 
attend Yale University, was my inspiration for going to Yale 
and becoming a lawyer. Next to her is her son and my cousin, 
Llewellyn Sanchez-Werner, who is a virtuoso concert pianist, an 
incredible talent and a friend. Next is my nine-year-old son, 
Conrad Sanchez. I&#x27;m so incredibly proud of him and grateful 
that he begrudgingly agreed to miss his cherished school in 
Berkeley, California, to join me on this trip. My wife, 
Christina Meyer--she is the love of my life and has been my 
best friend for twice as long as we&#x27;ve been married. The 
luckiest moment of my life was meeting her in the opening days 
of college.
    There are many other family members and loved ones who 
would not be here today but are with us in spirit. I want to 
briefly mention my mother-in-law, Patricia Meyer, and the Meyer 
family in the Bay Area; my father-in-law, Jay Meyer, who passed 
away in 2010; and, finally, my grandparents, Juan and Francisca 
Sanchez, who made the fateful decision to move their family 
from Mexico to California in the 1960&#x27;s to pursue their 
American dream. I have been blessed by that wise choice ever 
since then.
    I look forward to answering your questions. Thank you very 
much.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Judge Sanchez. I&#x27;ll start the 
questioning, and then Senator Grassley, Senator Feinstein, and 
Senator Lee, if he has returned; if not, Senator Kennedy will 
be recognized.
    Let me start by saying that it&#x27;s not uncommon for those 
coming before the Committee to have been involved in some 
aspect of a political life or in some legal practice, to have 
either worked on issues or taken positions on issues as it--
within the practice of law, represented clients who really 
spoke to a specific issue or set of beliefs, and the question&#x27;s 
then asked of the judicial nominee, ``Is this who you are? When 
cases come before you involving these same issues, what 
standard are you going to use?&#x27;&#x27;
    We look at your background and say, ``Well, he worked for 
Governor Brown. He was a legal assistant. He was involved in a 
lot of propositions and other things.&#x27;&#x27; What does that mean in 
terms of your philosophy, personal and political, and how it 
would affect you if you were a circuit judge?
    Judge Sanchez. Thank you, Senator. As you mentioned, my 
policy background involved advocating for different clients 
and, for a good portion of my career, for my main client, 
Governor Brown and trying to effectuate his policy goals and 
vision and litigate matters on behalf of many different 
clients. When I took the role of a judge on the appellate 
court, I left all that behind. I understand that being a judge 
requires being fair and neutral and applying the law fairly to 
all the parties that come before me, and the way I effectuate 
that is by making sure that I carefully read the parties&#x27; 
briefs and consider their arguments and consider the governing 
law and precedent and let those factors determine my judicial 
decision-making, not anything having to do with my prior 
policymaking or personal views, because our system of justice 
depends on a fair and impartial judiciary.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you. I just--I&#x27;m going to defer to the 
other Senators who may have questions and also say I am touched 
by your family&#x27;s immigrant story. There are many of us who have 
similar stories to tell, and I hope that we never forget the 
contribution that your family and families just like them have 
made to this great nation.
    Senator Grassley.
    Senator Grassley. Yes. You probably know that things you 
write in the past become questions for nominees before this 
Committee, so I&#x27;m going to go to what you authored, an article 
discussing the accomplishments of California&#x27;s newest justice, 
Joshua Groban. You admired that he placed a high premium on 
diversity of experience and, quote unquote, ``perspective&#x27;&#x27; 
when vetting potential nominees to the Federal judiciary. How 
does a judge&#x27;s perspective--your word--or personal experience 
inform the judge&#x27;s interpretation of law and then whether or 
not those experiences might conflict with--a judge supposed to 
interpret law and leave personal views out of his case?
    Judge Sanchez. Thank you, Senator Grassley. I believe the 
judiciary and judges, in particular, are enriched by having a 
diversity of professional backgrounds and viewpoints. I know 
that I have benefited from the diversity of backgrounds and 
perspectives of my colleagues, and it challenges me to keep an 
open mind and to consider their own perspectives. And so when I 
wrote that article, it was with that view in mind, that 
diversity of background, not only democratic diversity but also 
professional diversity and different ways of viewing the world, 
can help all of us in the way that we analyze cases. As you 
mentioned, and as I had mentioned earlier, the central focus of 
a judge is to apply the law impartially and fairly, and I try 
to do that every day with all of my cases, by considering their 
arguments, the limited record before me, the lower court&#x27;s 
decision and those governing precedent and standards, and let 
that determine the outcome of my decision-making.
    Senator Grassley. Okay. I want to go to your work on 
California Proposition 57, where a large number of criminal 
defendants were released to the public. Some convicted 
criminals were released early, before the proposition was even 
passed. Opponents of the proposition cited increasing crime 
statistics: a 10 percent increase in violent crime, 37 percent 
increase in rape the year before. Do you think the release of 
convicted violent criminals under Proposition 57 contributed to 
that increase?
    Judge Sanchez. Thank you, Senator. If I may provide a 
little context for the law. Proposition 57 was passed in 
response to a Federal court order that found that California&#x27;s 
prison system was unconstitutionally overcrowded. It was an 
order that was affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Brown v. 
Plata in 2011, and so Governor Brown was faced with the task of 
complying with the Court&#x27;s order in a way that would ensure 
that public safety would be protected. And the choice that he 
faced was either allowing the Federal courts to order the 
outright release of prisoners, to achieve that population 
reduction, or to create a system of parole consideration for 
non-violent offenders and sentencing credits that would allow 
inmates to earn their release from prison.
    The law itself did not automatically release anyone. What 
it gave was an opportunity for those to try to prove that they 
were worthy of release, in front of a parole board, or to 
complete rehabilitative programs to earn an earlier sentence. 
And in the Governor&#x27;s view, that was the safer way to approach 
the problem that we had to face, rather than indiscriminate 
releases by the courts.
    Senator Grassley. Okay. I&#x27;d like to have you talk about 
your trial experience, specifically your criminal trial 
experience. How many criminal trials have you personally 
appeared in court for? Explain that role.
    Judge Sanchez. In litigation at my private law firm, I was 
involved in one criminal defense, and it was in State court, 
and that was at the early stage of that process, through the 
preliminary hearing, and then the matter was stayed as we 
petitioned for review before the California Supreme Court. I do 
not have a great deal of criminal trial experience, but in my 
role in the State government, I had to deal with many criminal 
issues and corrections issues over the course of many years. As 
an appellate justice, fully half of my caseload, of the 490 or 
so cases that I have issued or joined, have involved criminal 
appeals--and have had to develop a deep knowledge base on those 
issues.
    Senator Grassley. Thank you for your answers.
    Judge Sanchez. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Feinstein.
    Senator Feinstein. Along those lines, if I might, Justice 
Sanchez, you were appointed by Governor Jerry Brown to serve on 
the California Court of Appeal for the First Appellate District 
in 2018. You&#x27;ve been very active on that court during the last 
three years. I noted, in reviewing your experience, that you 
have filed or joined in nearly 500 opinions during your time as 
a State appellate judge. Here&#x27;s the question. How do you 
believe your experience serving as a State appellate judge on 
the California Court of Appeal has helped to prepare you for a 
Federal appellate judge, if you are confirmed to the Ninth 
Circuit, and what kind of a judge would you strive to be?
    Judge Sanchez. Thank you, Senator Feinstein. I have 
addressed a wide range of State and Federal legal issues in the 
cases that have come before me, and as you said, it was--I 
authored or joined in nearly 500 opinions on a wide range of 
matters, from civil, criminal, statutory and constitutional 
interpretation, administrative reviews, environmental reviews, 
and I believe that those--that skill set and those experiences 
would translate to the Federal appellate court, if confirmed. I 
love delving into new areas of law and wrapping my arms around 
complex factual and legal matters and the back-and-forth with 
counsel and keeping flexibility in my way of thinking before I 
determine what I believe is the right outcome, and I would take 
those concepts, those guideposts, with me if I were to be 
confirmed on the Federal Court of Appeal.
    Senator Feinstein. Well, let&#x27;s speak for a moment about 
those guideposts. You&#x27;ve been very active on the Court of 
Appeal during the last three years. I noted, in reviewing your 
experience, that you have filed or joined in nearly 500 
opinions during your time as a State appellate judge. How do 
you believe that your experience serving as a State appellate 
judge on this Court of Appeal has helped to prepare you to 
serve as a Federal appellate judge? What will the people of 
California be getting, in terms of you reflecting your 
background?
    Judge Sanchez. Senator, they will be getting a judge that 
takes his oath of office very seriously in approaching each 
case individually, with a fair perspective for both sides. I 
try very hard not to bring in any preconceptions or to reserve 
judgment as I read the parties&#x27; briefs and consider their 
arguments and research the applicable law and the governing 
standards, and those--those processes that I apply today, as an 
appellate justice, I would apply as a Federal Appellate Court 
judge and, ultimately, when I render a decision to write an 
opinion that is--provides a clear basis of my decision and 
clarity to the parties that came before me into the lower 
courts, for them to follow.
    Senator Feinstein. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Judge Sanchez. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator. Senator Kennedy, do you 
wish to ask?
    Senator Kennedy. I do. Chairman, thank you.
    Chair Durbin. You&#x27;re recognized.
    Senator Kennedy. Thank you, sir. Judge, congratulations.
    Judge Sanchez. Thank you.
    Senator Kennedy. I&#x27;m not going to ask you to comment on 
precedents or cases of the Supreme Court. Is that okay with 
you?
    Judge Sanchez. Okay.
    Senator Kennedy. Good. I just want to try to understand the 
way you think and what your beliefs are. When, in your opinion, 
does life begin?
    Judge Sanchez. Well, Senator, from my reading of Supreme 
Court precedent----
    Senator Kennedy. No, sir. I&#x27;m not interested in the law. 
I&#x27;m interested in you. When, in your opinion, does life begin?
    Senator Feinstein. Can you speak into the microphone?
    Senator Kennedy. You can&#x27;t hear me?
    Senator Feinstein. No, I can&#x27;t.
    Senator Kennedy. Can you hear me now?
    Chair Durbin. And we----
    Senator Feinstein. Oh, yes.
    Chair Durbin [continuing]. Want to.
    Senator Kennedy. Do you want me to start over?
    Chair Durbin. No.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Kennedy. Well, I just used 20 seconds. I want you 
to add 20 seconds to my--let me ask----
    Chair Durbin. Or----
    Senator Kennedy. Let me ask the question again. When, in 
your opinion, does life begin?
    Judge Sanchez. Well, Senator, I don&#x27;t believe my own 
personal views enter into the picture----
    Senator Kennedy. I know. I----
    Judge Sanchez [continuing]. As a judge.
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. Understand that you&#x27;re going 
to follow precedent. I&#x27;m just asking you. I want to get to know 
you. You&#x27;re going to be on the Court of Appeal, if you&#x27;re 
confirmed. When, in your opinion, does life begin?
    Judge Sanchez. What I was explaining is, whatever my 
personal views on those areas, I do set them to one side, 
because it is----
    Senator Kennedy. I understand that. I&#x27;m trying to 
understand what those opinions are. Are you going to answer my 
question?
    Judge Sanchez. In answering, I would not want to give the 
impression that I&#x27;m prejudging a situation or----
    Senator Kennedy. I will stipulate you&#x27;re not prejudging.
    Judge Sanchez [continuing]. Or allowing my own personal 
views----
    Senator Kennedy. I&#x27;ll stipulate that.
    Judge Sanchez [continuing]. To pervade into--and so--well, 
I--Senator, respectfully----
    Senator Kennedy. Have you thought about it?
    Judge Sanchez. About when life begins?
    Senator Kennedy. Yes.
    Judge Sanchez. Yes.
    Senator Kennedy. What did you conclude?
    Judge Sanchez. I conclude that, as a judicial nominee and a 
sitting judge, I would not want those views to weigh into how I 
approach cases, and I would follow Supreme Court precedent----
    Senator Kennedy. All right.
    Judge Sanchez [continuing]. Its guiding precedent.
    Senator Kennedy. All right. I get it. Let me ask you your 
thoughts on another subject. Biologically, how many sexes are 
there?
    Judge Sanchez. As I understand it, there are different 
views on that topic.
    Senator Kennedy. I&#x27;m asking you your view.
    Judge Sanchez. I--again, that is an area that I believe 
could come before me as an issue, as it has come recently.
    Senator Kennedy. I&#x27;m not asking about a case. I&#x27;m asking 
about you. Biologically, in your opinion, as a thinking adult, 
how many sexes are there?
    Judge Sanchez. I--Senator, as I said before, my own 
personal views--I don&#x27;t want them to enter into my role as a 
judge, and so if I were to be faced with an issue where a 
person&#x27;s sex or gender came before me, I would apply that 
Supreme Court precedent----
    Senator Kennedy. Right.
    Judge Sanchez [continuing]. Consider it in the context of--
--
    Senator Kennedy. We stipulated to that. We stipulated to 
that. I&#x27;m asking you personally. Biologically, how many sexes 
are there, in your opinion?
    Judge Sanchez. I would give the same answer as before, 
where I would not want to give an answer of my personal view 
and give the impression that I&#x27;m prejudging an issue myself.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. Have you thought about it?
    Judge Sanchez. I have.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. What was your conclusion?
    Judge Sanchez. That it is a matter of importance and debate 
in our society today and, while I have my own personal views 
about it, my role as a judge is to apply the law and precedent 
and let the arguments and facts speak for themselves.
    Senator Kennedy. All right. In your opinion, is the 
California Court of Appeals systemically racist?
    Judge Sanchez. Senator, I have not had occasion to consider 
whether a court system is systemically racist as a court. As a 
general matter, I believe judges take their oath of office very 
seriously and try----
    Senator Kennedy. I agree with----
    Judge Sanchez [continuing]. To consider----
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. That, but what about the 
California Court of Appeal? Is it systemically racist?
    Judge Sanchez. As I said, if there is--if the issue of 
systemic racism were to come in, I would consider it within the 
context of whatever the arguments are.
    Senator Kennedy. Have you thought about it?
    Judge Sanchez. As a private citizen, as a general matter, I 
know that systemic racism is a topic of discussion.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. Is the Court of Appeal, in your 
opinion, on which you sit, systemically racist?
    Judge Sanchez. I believe that the judges which serve on the 
Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court try to handle----
    Senator Kennedy. I want you to answer my questions.
    Judge Sanchez [continuing]. Try to handle their cases----
    Senator Kennedy. Why won&#x27;t you answer my questions, Judge?
    Judge Sanchez. I&#x27;m sorry, Senator, I----
    Senator Kennedy. Here&#x27;s my final one. What&#x27;s your favorite 
color?
    Judge Sanchez. Blue.
    Senator Kennedy. Good. That was easy. I don&#x27;t understand 
why you won&#x27;t answer my questions. You&#x27;re not the first nominee 
that has come forward that refuses to answer a single question 
in five minutes. How can I vote for you, if you won&#x27;t answer my 
questions?
    Judge Sanchez. Senator, if systemic racism were a matter 
that came before me----
    Senator Kennedy. I didn&#x27;t ask that. I stipulated that 
wasn&#x27;t going to be the case. I&#x27;m just asking your opinion. You 
sit on the bench. Do you think it&#x27;s systemically racist? But I 
do understand your favorite color, and I appreciate that. Thank 
you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you. Senator Lee.
    Senator Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thought you were 
calling him Senator Lee, for a minute. I was about to introduce 
myself. Thanks for being here. You&#x27;ve been on the California 
Court of Appeals now since 2018, so about three years, going on 
four, perhaps. How are the--under the Constitution of the State 
of California, how are the justiciability rules different under 
the California constitution than under the Federal system? Do 
you have the same concept of Article III justiciability?
    Judge Sanchez. Thank you, Senator Lee. As I think about it, 
I think the rules of justiciability generally pattern after the 
Federal rules within the California State system, and----
    Senator Lee. Right.
    Judge Sanchez [continuing].They are considered in similar 
ways.
    Senator Lee. Right. You&#x27;re familiar with Article III 
justiciability? What are the elements of Article III 
justiciability? What do you have to have, to have a justiciable 
case in Federal court?
    Judge Sanchez. Are you referring to standing itself, or----
    Senator Lee. Yes. Standing, ripeness----
    Judge Sanchez. Sure.
    Senator Lee [continuing]. Mootness. Every element of it.
    Judge Sanchez. Sure. Well, for standing, under the Lujan--
Supreme Court&#x27;s case in Lujan, a claimant has to have an injury 
in fact, a legal injury that is concrete and particularized, as 
well as some sort of causal connection between the claimed 
misconduct and the injury, and finally, that it&#x27;s likely to be 
redressed. Ripeness occurs if--when a court decides whether the 
matter should be heard at a particular time, and there is the 
related doctrine of mootness, if something has occurred that 
would render a court&#x27;s decision to be advisory or whether 
there&#x27;s a--likely to have a recurrence in the case before you.
    Senator Lee. In Federal court, when does--when is there 
subject-matter jurisdiction over a case, in Federal court?
    Judge Sanchez. Subject-matter jurisdiction would occur, 
Senator, if it&#x27;s a question of Federal law, whether it&#x27;s 
statutory or constitutional, or if it comes up under diversity 
jurisdiction between citizens of different States.
    Senator Lee. Can that ever be waived?
    Judge Sanchez. I&#x27;m sorry?
    Senator Lee. Can that be waived?
    Judge Sanchez. No. Subject-matter jurisdiction is a 
requirement of entering into Federal court.
    Senator Lee. Which--under what circumstances should a 
Federal court apply State law?
    Judge Sanchez. Federal court should apply State law when 
they&#x27;re sitting in diversity, and also, if there are ancillary 
State issues within a Federal case, the Federal court might, as 
a discretionary matter, take on those ancillary State issues 
along with the Federal claims that it&#x27;s considering.
    Senator Lee. What about Federal common law?
    Judge Sanchez. Federal common law, as I understand it, 
applies in a narrow--not frequently. There may be Federal 
procedural issues that come up under Federal common law, but 
it&#x27;s--but there&#x27;s--it&#x27;s very limited.
    Senator Lee. How--now, you clerked for a Federal judge on 
the court to which you&#x27;ve now been nominated, Judge Paez. Would 
you identify Judge Paez as one who would be a judicial role 
model of sorts?
    Judge Sanchez. I would.
    Senator Lee. How would you describe your judicial 
philosophy?
    Judge Sanchez. My judicial philosophy is to give--to apply 
each case fairly and neutrally and to allow the parties to have 
that sense that they are--have a fair stake in arguing their 
own sides, and I will apply each--to each matter a thoughtful 
and neutral approach to deciding their issues.
    Senator Lee. How about statutory construction? What&#x27;s your 
approach to construing the meaning of a Federal statute?
    Judge Sanchez. The Supreme Court has guided lower courts to 
look first at the statutory provision itself, in the context of 
the purpose and overall structure of the statutory scheme. I 
would look to the plain language of the text of the statute as 
the starting point of analysis to discern what legislative 
intent should be.
    Senator Lee. When would that starting point not also be the 
finishing point?
    Judge Sanchez. If there&#x27;s ambiguity in the statutory text 
or ambiguity in the way that the text is written, in the 
context of the purpose and overall structure of the statute, 
then there may be other tools to also look to, to try to have a 
more confirming sense of what Congress intended.
    Senator Lee. What about discerning the subjective intent of 
a Congress in enacting legislation? Assume, for purposes of our 
discussion, we&#x27;re talking about text as to which there&#x27;s an 
ambiguity. How do you ascertain Congress&#x27;s intent, 
subjectively?
    Judge Sanchez. Well, the Supreme Court has said to look at 
committee reports as a source of legislative history, but the 
Court has also cautioned lower courts that stray remarks or 
individual comments by a Senator shouldn&#x27;t be overblown, in a 
sense, or taken to encompass congressional intent.
    Senator Lee. How could one meaningfully differentiate a 
committee report, which may reflect the views only of the 
author, who may not even be a member, from stray remarks made 
by a legislator on the floor in committee?
    Judge Sanchez. Well, I would say, Senator, that it&#x27;s in the 
context of whatever&#x27;s being read, and if it&#x27;s a stray remark 
that only happens once or in an isolated instance, I don&#x27;t 
think that stray remark would be given any weight, as opposed 
to if the statements themselves----
    Senator Lee. What if there are ten lawmakers who both--who 
all say the same thing?
    Judge Sanchez. There may be a little more weight to that, 
but as I said, those--that legislative analysis is done in the 
context of what the statutory text itself says and the purpose 
of the statute. Really the driving force behind that analysis 
tends to be more in those earlier factors than the legislative 
history itself.
    Senator Lee. Yes. I see my time is expired. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Lee. Senator Cruz, you&#x27;re 
the remaining Senator to ask, if you wish.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Sanchez, you 
played an instrumental role in drafting and implementing 
Proposition 57. You were an advisor to Governor Brown. You were 
an author of the bill, and you helped craft and coordinate 
messaging in favor of the measure.
    Opponents of Proposition 57, at the time, warned you--
warned that you and other authors were not telling the truth, 
were not being candid about the effect of that proposition. 
They said it would apply to violent criminals such as rapists, 
when their victim is drugged; to human sex traffickers; to 
those who committed hate crimes; and to others whom the average 
person would not consider non-violent. At the time of the 
drafting, was your intent to make those individuals eligible 
for parole?
    Judge Sanchez. Thank you, Senator, for that question. As I 
said before, as I mentioned earlier, the law itself did not 
automatically release any individual. It only provided parole 
consideration for non-violent offenders and a sentencing 
scheme--a system of sentencing credits for rehabilitative 
programs. The Proposition 57 and the implementing regulations 
did not define who was a violent or non-violent offender. That 
was made by reference to existing California penal code, and 
the intent in the passage of that law was to allow those parole 
consideration in order to comply with the Federal court order 
that California reduce its prison population to a 
constitutionally tolerable level.
    Senator Cruz. Okay. Let me try again on that question. 
Let&#x27;s take them one at a time. Let&#x27;s take rapists, when their 
victim is drugged. Was it your intent that a rapist who had 
drugged his victim should be eligible for parole?
    Judge Sanchez. Well, let me start by saying, Senator, I 
worked for Governor Brown as a staff member, and so I worked to 
effectuate his policy goals, but----
    Senator Cruz. Did you disagree with him on Proposition 57?
    Judge Sanchez. No. What I----
    Senator Cruz. Okay. Well, then----
    Judge Sanchez. What the----
    Senator Cruz [continuing]. Let me ask you again. You played 
a leading role in this. If you want to disagree with it and 
say, ``Hey, the Governor was wrong, and I was following 
orders,&#x27;&#x27; that&#x27;s one thing. If you&#x27;re not going to say that, 
then I&#x27;m going to return to my question. Was it your intent--
and let&#x27;s take the first example I gave, rapists who drug their 
victims. Was it your intent that that rapist should be eligible 
for parole?
    Judge Sanchez. Governor Brown&#x27;s intent was in complying 
with a Federal court order.
    Senator Cruz. Yes, but let me focus on your intent, because 
you&#x27;re the one nominated for a lifetime appointment to the 
Court of Appeals.
    Judge Sanchez. My intent was in serving the Governor&#x27;s 
policy vision and goals, and the overall purpose of the law was 
to respond to a Federal court order that had been affirmed by 
the U.S. Supreme Court.
    Senator Cruz. Okay. Let me try it again. Let&#x27;s ask a 
different question. How about human sex traffickers? Was it 
your intention, as one of the leading drafters, that human sex 
traffickers should be eligible for parole?
    Judge Sanchez. The intent of the law was to provide parole 
consideration for non-violent offenders as defined by existing 
California penal code.
    Senator Cruz. Do you dispute that human sex traffickers 
would be eligible for parole under it?
    Judge Sanchez. The--if whatever crime was defined as non-
violent under the California penal code----
    Senator Cruz. Would human sex traffickers qualify? Yes or 
no?
    Judge Sanchez. I believe sex trafficking--well, I would 
reference the California penal code to determine whether that 
was a violent or a non-violent category of crime.
    Senator Cruz. All right. How about those who have committed 
hate crimes?
    Judge Sanchez. As I sit here today, I&#x27;m not aware in which 
side hate crimes fall under. There can be circumstances where--
--
    Senator Cruz. You didn&#x27;t spend a lot of time focused on 
that question?
    Judge Sanchez. No, I--what I would say is that with any of 
these categories I would follow--or what we did was follow 
California penal code as to define who was a violent or non-
violent offender.
    Senator Cruz. Several reports indicate that violent 
criminals have been subject to parole, likely criminals that 
the unsuspecting public did not intend on releasing when they 
passed Proposition 57. Sex offenders, gang members, batterers 
of police officers have been made subject to parole. As a 
result of your direct efforts, violent criminals were paroled, 
and California was made less safe.
    I guess my question is, did you intend for violent 
criminals to be released early, or were you simply unaware of 
the consequences of your action? Which one was it? Did you know 
what you were doing, or did you not know what you were doing?
    Judge Sanchez. Thank you, Senator. The intention of the law 
was to comply with that Federal court order, and the choice 
that Governor Brown faced was creating----
    Senator Cruz. I&#x27;m not asking about the Governor. The 
Governor has not been nominated to the Ninth Circuit. You have. 
I&#x27;m interested in a litigant who would appear before you who 
might very well be troubled about a judge who is soft on crime, 
who wants violent criminals--who is fine with violent criminals 
being released early. That would trouble a great many 
litigants. I think that would trouble a great many Californians 
who believed that this proposition was not affecting violent 
criminals, when in fact it was. My question is, what was your 
intention--not Governor Brown&#x27;s, not anyone else--your 
intention, and were you aware of what you were doing? Did you 
know violent criminals would be released early, when you were 
helping lead the efforts to pass this proposition?
    Judge Sanchez. As I mentioned earlier, the law--the choice 
that was faced was between allowing Federal courts to order the 
outright releases of prisoners without any sort of 
rehabilitation efforts or to create a system of parole 
consideration and sentencing credits to address an order that 
the U.S. Supreme Court had affirmed, and the Governor----
    Senator Cruz. My time has expired, but let me just try one 
final time. Were you aware violent criminals would be released 
early under this? Yes or no?
    Judge Sanchez. Senator, I--we were aware, and the 
Governor&#x27;s--at the Governor&#x27;s direction--that it would affect 
the entire population of the prison system, hopefully to get 
people to rehabilitate and to improve their lives before----
    Senator Cruz. That sounds like a yes. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Senator from Texas, time has expired. Senator 
from Tennessee.
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate 
that. Justice Sanchez, thank you for coming before us today. A 
timely question for you, do you believe that the right to keep 
and bear and own arms is a civil right?
    Judge Sanchez. Senator, under Heller, it is a--the right to 
keep and bear arms is a constitutional right that all citizens 
possess.
    Senator Blackburn. Do you support the Second Amendment?
    Judge Sanchez. Senator, I support all amendments, all 
express rights that are in the Bill of Rights, and rights that 
are recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court.
    Senator Blackburn. Okay. Let&#x27;s talk about this--continuing 
with California Proposition 57. There are a lot of Californians 
that are moving to Tennessee. One of the reasons that they cite 
for leaving the State are very high taxes, and another is a 
whole lot of crime and the way crime on the streets has changed 
so many of the communities. I know you didn&#x27;t want to answer 
Senator Cruz&#x27;s question, but let me come at it a different way, 
because when you look at the work that you have done on this--
talk to me about what guides your judicial philosophy on 
sentencing.
    Judge Sanchez. Okay. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Blackburn. Yes.
    Judge Sanchez. My policymaking past is just that. I served 
as a staff member for Governor Brown, working to effectuate his 
policy goals----
    Senator Blackburn. What principles guide you?
    Judge Sanchez. It----
    Senator Blackburn. What is the purpose of punishment?
    Judge Sanchez. I----
    Senator Blackburn. Because, see, you&#x27;ve just talked about--
you knew there were people that were going to be released. You 
were hopeful people were going to go through rehab, but then 
you kind of contradict yourself. Why don&#x27;t we do this? Why 
don&#x27;t you just submit for the record what your philosophy is on 
sentencing and what you think is the purpose of incarceration, 
the purpose of punishment?
    Because I don&#x27;t know of anybody--I talk to people that have 
moved out of California, every single day, and they are so 
frustrated with the way the state is being run, and so they&#x27;re 
choosing to leave.
    Let me move on to People v. Silas----
    Judge Sanchez. Okay.
    Senator Blackburn [continuing]. And ask you about that. 
Now, I understand that involved a peremptory strike on a 
prospective Black juror, correct?
    Judge Sanchez. Yes.
    Senator Blackburn. Okay. As I understand it, the 
prosecution exercised a peremptory strike against a Black juror 
who expressed support for Black Lives Matter, citing the 
juror&#x27;s hostility when asked about BLM. You issued a decision 
that suggested that the prosecutor&#x27;s peremptory strike was 
actually motivated by discriminatory intent based on the 
juror&#x27;s race. I would like to know more about your thinking in 
that case, because it seems to me, as I looked at it, that 
you&#x27;re conflating support for BLM, which says that they are 
trained Marxist leaders in this group, that you&#x27;re equating 
that with race. Why don&#x27;t you talk just a touch about that? 
We&#x27;ve got a limited time here.
    Judge Sanchez. Thank you, Senator. As you mentioned, the 
claim was brought under Batson v. Kentucky, in which the 
Supreme Court held that use of a peremptory challenge by the 
prosecution, to excuse a juror on the basis of race, violates 
the equal protection clause. On review of that appeal, we 
looked at the three-part analysis of whether the plaintiff had 
made a prima facie case of discriminatory intent.
    In that case, the questioning was conceded by the Attorney 
General to have been inappropriate with regard to the Black 
Lives Matter movement, but there were other indicia in the 
record, as well, of evidence of a discriminatory motive. For 
example, the prosecutor&#x27;s explanation for excusing the juror 
involved that the potential juror was late, when, in fact, it 
was a different African-American juror that had been late, and 
there were other aspects of the record that supported an 
indicia that the prosecutor was substantially motivated, at 
least in part, by a discriminatory purpose.
    Senator Blackburn. Okay.
    Judge Sanchez. It wasn&#x27;t only Black Lives Matter, but that 
played a big role in the case.
    Senator Blackburn. Okay. Thank you for that. Demand Justice 
is a far-left group that is supporting your nomination, and 
you&#x27;ve expressed preference for--and I&#x27;m quoting--``diversity 
of experience and perspective&#x27;&#x27; in the courts. In light of 
this, I would like for you to define what you see as being 
appropriate action on the bench and judicial activism.
    Judge Sanchez. Thank you, Senator. Judicial activism, to 
me, means when a judge allows their personal viewpoints or 
policy perspectives to pervade their decision-making. It is not 
an appropriate thing for any judge to do. A judge should 
consider the court, the parties&#x27; arguments, the lower court&#x27;s 
decision, and the governing law, and----
    Senator Blackburn. Demand Justice likes activist judges, 
and they&#x27;re supporting you. Do you agree with their 
philosophies?
    Judge Sanchez. Senator, I&#x27;m not familiar with Demand 
Justice&#x27;s philosophies. I can only speak to how I approach each 
individual case that comes before me.
    Senator Blackburn. Okay. All right. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you. Senator Tillis, do you have any 
questions of this witness?
    Senator Tillis. I do not.
    Chair Durbin. Okay. Judge Sanchez, thanks for being here 
today. There may be some written questions sent your way. If 
you could respond to those in a timely way, we&#x27;d appreciate it.
    [The information appears as a submission for the record.]
    Judge Sanchez. Thank you, Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you. We&#x27;re on a roll call on the floor, 
which is going to mean that we have to take a break here as we 
set up for the second panel. I hope you&#x27;ll forgive us, but we 
didn&#x27;t anticipate that we would run into that. We&#x27;ll be back in 
just a few minutes, perhaps ten, and resume the hearing. We&#x27;ll 
stand in recess.
    [Whereupon the Committee was recessed and reconvened.]
    Chair Durbin. Thank you. The Senate Judiciary Committee 
will resume its consideration--and I would say for the record 
that that was a footrace between Senator Blackburn and myself, 
and she had to go to her office first, but it ended up in a 
tie, but we&#x27;re leaning toward giving her the trophy because she 
did it in high heels. We thank her--like Ginger Rogers--for 
extraordinary performance.
    Welcome to the second panel, and I&#x27;d ask you each to stand 
as we administer the oath.
    [Witnesses are sworn in.]
    Every one of the panelists answered in the affirmative, so 
we can now proceed. You each have five minutes, and according 
to my list, first up is Ms. Elliott.
    Ms. Elliott. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. You need to activate the microphone. There we 
go.
    Ms. Elliott. Thank you. I hope I&#x27;ve set an example for the 
rest.

               STATEMENT OF SAMANTHA D. ELLIOTT,

             NOMINATED TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT

            JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE

    Ms. Elliott. First, I&#x27;d like to thank Senator Shaheen and 
Senator Hassan for their generous introductions and for 
recommending me to the President. Thank you to Chair Durbin and 
Ranking Member Grassley for convening this hearing and to all 
the Members of the Committee for considering my nomination.
    I&#x27;m truly thankful to President Biden for the greatest 
honor of this nomination to the District Court of New 
Hampshire. I&#x27;m lucky to have many family members in attendance, 
but I&#x27;d like to first acknowledge my family, friends, and 
colleagues who are not here: my mother, Judy Campbell, who&#x27;s 
inspired me by example and taught me that the secret to a good 
life is to work hard and smile easily; to my grandmother 
Phyllis Campbell and my stepmother, Susan Dumais, whose love 
and support has meant so much to me; my colleagues at 
Gallagher, Callahan &amp; Gartrell, where I&#x27;ve spent my entire 
career, who have played such a big part in fostering my love 
for the law.
    With me is my sister, Christine Preston and her husband, 
Michael Preston, who have traveled here from Madison, New 
Jersey, to support me. I&#x27;ve always been moved by their 
commitment to the public interest. My parents-in-law, Tom and 
Sally Elliott, from Spotsylvania, Virginia, who have been the 
best cheerleaders; my brother-in-law, Michael Elliott, with 
whom I&#x27;ve had the privilege to attend both college and law 
school, so it only seemed fitting to have him here with me 
today. Behind me is my son Henry, 13, whose love of history I 
hope will keep him awake and alert while we answer your 
questions. My daughter Fiona, 16, is learning about the world 
by finishing her final two years in high school studying in 
Norway, so she understandably could not make the trip. Last but 
not least, my husband, Matt Elliott, who specifically requested 
to be introduced to you as my rock.
    [Laughter.]
    In all reality, nothing I&#x27;ve ever done in the past 26 years 
would have been possible without his support, and the sheer 
number of oral arguments he&#x27;s had to sit through while I 
practiced has earned him the honor of that title. Again, I&#x27;m 
beyond grateful, and I look forward to answering any questions 
you might have.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you very much. Ms. Lopez.

              STATEMENT OF LINDA LOPEZ, NOMINATED

               TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE

            FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA

    Ms. Lopez. Good morning. Thank you, Chairman Durbin and 
Ranking Member Grassley, for scheduling this hearing. Senators 
Feinstein and Senator Padilla, I thank them so much for their 
kind introduction and for their support. I&#x27;d like to thank 
President Biden for the honor of this nomination. I am truly 
humbled. And to the esteemed Members of this Committee, I thank 
you for your consideration.
    I grew up in a working class neighborhood in South Florida. 
My brother, my sister, and I were taught the importance of hard 
work, kindness, determination, and honesty. These were the 
cornerstones of our upbringing. When I was 11 years old, I lost 
my mom. While my father faced many challenges raising three 
young children on his own, he made certain that we knew we were 
loved and protected and reminded us often of the importance of 
hard work, kindness, determination, and honesty.
    While neither of them are here with me today, I know they 
are in spirit. The lessons that they have taught me have served 
me well. By living my life adhering to these core principles, I 
have in turn been blessed with wonderful friends, colleagues, 
and mentors, too many to mention here this morning, but all who 
have helped me become a better woman, wife, mother, lawyer, and 
judge.
    My children, Riley and Angel, are so proud of me. I know 
they&#x27;re rooting for me. My brother Robert, my sister Ida, and 
their respective families are back in Miami, extremely excited 
and proud that I am here before each of you. With me today is 
my husband, Victor, who has been my greatest friend, husband, 
and a fantastic father. I could not be here without his 
support.
    Also with me are my law clerks, Felicia, Ami, and Spencer. 
I appreciate each of you so very much. I try to tell you often, 
but please know how much you all mean to me. To my entire court 
family back in San Diego and all of my friends who have offered 
their support, I am very blessed to be here. Senators, I look 
forward to any questions.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you very much. Judge Menendez.

             STATEMENT OF KATHERINE MARIE MENENDEZ,

             NOMINATED TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT

              JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA

    Judge Menendez. Thank you. It&#x27;s an honor to be here, Chair 
Durbin, and thank you for convening this hearing, as well as 
thanks to Ranking Member Grassley. Enormous appreciation to 
Senator Klobuchar for the humbling introduction, and to 
Senators Klobuchar and Smith for supporting my nomination, and 
to President Biden for showing faith in me by nominating me to 
this important position, and to the Judicial Selection 
Committee, convened by the Senators, that recommended me.
    I&#x27;d like to acknowledge my family that&#x27;s here with me 
today: my husband, Dan Rogan, and my sons Riley and Finn. My 
husband has been my biggest champion and cheerleader throughout 
my career, and I wouldn&#x27;t be here today without him. I&#x27;d also 
like to acknowledge my mom, Susan Ireland, who always taught me 
the importance of public service, from the time I was a little 
kid, and my brother, Adam Menendez. They&#x27;re watching and 
cheering from the West Coast. Last, to all the Rogans out there 
in Minnesota who are also enormous supporters.
    I am humbled to be among such impressive co-panelists. I 
was wowed when I heard their introductions this morning, and 
I&#x27;m very honored to have been nominated to have a seat on the 
District Court of the District of Minnesota. I practiced in 
front of this district court for more than 18 years. I was 
chosen by this district court to be a magistrate judge, where 
I&#x27;ve served for five and a half years, and it would be the 
honor of a lifetime to take a seat among them. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Judge. Judge Ohta. Is the microphone 
on? There we go.

              STATEMENT OF JINSOOK OHTA, NOMINATED

               TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE

            FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA

    Judge Ohta. Thank you, Chairman Durbin and Ranking Member 
Grassley and the Senators of this Committee. I&#x27;d also like to 
thank Senators Padilla and Feinstein for the kind introduction 
and placing their confidence in me. Thank you, President Biden, 
for the deep honor of this nomination.
    When I was six years old, I emigrated from South Korea with 
my parents, Tae Won Lee and Jung Soon Lee, who are sitting 
behind me, and my sister, Jin Sun Lee. My parents lived hard 
immigrant lives, where they struggled with the language so that 
I could have these opportunities, and every day they showed me 
an example of what uncomplaining hard work and courage in the 
face of daily obstacles looks like. I am deeply gratified, 
grateful, and honored by this nomination that reaffirms their 
choices, their sacrifices, and their deep faith in this great 
country.
    Thank you to the judges of the San Diego Superior Court, 
who are covering my courtroom so I could be in Washington, D.C. 
this week, and a special thank you to Judge Barry Ted Moskowitz 
of the Southern District of California. I clerked for him for 
two years, but his example, his mentorship, his guidance has 
buoyed me and sustained me for the past 20 years. Finally, I 
owe more than I can express to the unwavering love and support 
of my family, my friends, and team who are represented here 
today by Leslie Park and Devin Mauney; my parents-in-law, Helen 
and Douglas Ohta, who are watching my children at home; and 
especially my husband, Jason Ohta, who is here with me, and my 
two sons, who are supporting me from back in San Diego, 
California. I look forward to answering your questions.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you. Mr. Urias.

               STATEMENT OF DAVID HERRERA URIAS,

             NOMINATED TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT

              JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO

    Mr. Urias. Thank you, Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member 
Grassley, all the Members of this Committee, for inviting me 
today to this hearing to consider my nomination to be a Federal 
district court judge for the District of New Mexico. I also 
want to thank both of the outstanding Senators from the great 
State of New Mexico, Senator Heinrich and Senator Ben Ray 
Lujan, for their kind words and their warm introduction this 
morning. I would also especially like to thank President Biden 
for the nomination, which has been the greatest honor that I 
have received in my legal career.
    I&#x27;d also like to introduce some of the very important 
people in my life who have supported me not only through this 
process but through my entire life, starting first with those 
who could not be here today, my mom, Estella Herrera Urias, who 
taught me right from wrong, taught me just about everything 
that I know, really, been my guiding light since the time I was 
born, and who consistently drives me to be a better person. I&#x27;m 
sure right now my mom is sitting somewhere in front of a 
computer in New Mexico trying to figure out how to watch this 
live.
    [Laughter.]
    I hope that somebody is helping her with that.
    I also want to thank my father, David Urias, who&#x27;s watching 
today from above and who, along with my mom, instilled in me a 
sense of strong family values and faith and who always 
encouraged me to better myself and reach for those goals, even 
those that seemed unattainable. Also watching today from New 
Mexico is my sister, Gina Sandoval, and watching from the State 
of Washington is my brother, Robert Urias. I want to thank them 
both for being such a huge part of my life and for their 
unwavering support and love.
    Present with me today are a few people. Members of my 
immediate family, first, what I call my gaggle of sons. There&#x27;s 
five of them behind me: Cristobal, Gabriel, and Tomas; my 
nephews, whom I&#x27;ve been raising since they were young boys and 
who I consider to be my sons, Estevan and Elias. If you look 
back there, they&#x27;re all in matching grey suits, and they all 
look better than I&#x27;ve ever seen them look before, so I&#x27;m very 
proud of them.
    [Laughter.]
    All of these boys are the pride of my life, and I cannot 
understate how important it is that they are here, although I 
do have to tell them that I expect them to make up their 
schoolwork when they get back to New Mexico.
    Also sitting behind me is the love of my life, my wife, 
Yolanda. I think she&#x27;s two rows back. We have been married now 
for almost 25 years, and I really owe everything that I am and 
all that I will be to her. I want to thank her for her enduring 
love and partnership.
    Present today also are three dear friends of mine, starting 
first with Michael Aguilar, who is my cousin and my best 
friend. We&#x27;ve been raised together since we were small kids. He 
traveled all the way from Rio Rancho, New Mexico to attend 
today. My friend and former work colleague, David Hinojosa, who 
hails from San Antonio but is now doing great work with the 
Lawyers Committee on Civil Rights here in DC. And Hon. Vanessa 
Ruiz of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, who I 
clerked for almost 20 years ago, and who taught me what it 
means to be a good lawyer, really, and by example, what it 
means to be a fair, impartial, and just judge. I thank all of 
these important people for their support, and I look forward to 
the questions.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Mr. Urias. I want to thank each 
and every one of you and your families for being with you at 
this important day in your lives. Each one of these nominees 
has been rated ``well qualified&#x27;&#x27; by the American Bar 
Association. Congratulations. That speaks to your competence 
and honesty. Your peers have reached that conclusion, and that 
isn&#x27;t always the case with nominees before this Committee in 
previous years, but the Senators have worked with President 
Biden to make certain that each nominee that has come through 
here this year has at least reached this standard. My 
congratulations to you.
    I also--since all of you sat through Judge Sanchez&#x27;s 
previous panel questioning, you realize that if you want to 
aspire to be a judge at some point in your life, you should not 
write a letter to the editor when you&#x27;re in college or do 
anything else that might get you in trouble 20 or 30 years 
later. In all honesty, that is the world that we live in, as 
politicians, and that world is being superimposed on judicial 
nominees, to have them explain things that they did not think 
were that important in their life but turn out to be very 
important in the eyes of the Senators.
    Many years ago, before I got actively engaged in politics, 
I practiced law in the Central District of Illinois and 
appeared before Federal judges and had cases in Federal court, 
and I quickly realized that most of the judges knew the law and 
certainly applied it as best they could, but there was such a 
difference in temperament with these judges. There were some 
that I thought were the best of the best, and others not so.
    I&#x27;d like to ask you about the question of temperament, and 
I&#x27;m going to ask you a more specific question. You&#x27;ve all 
worked with judges and appeared before them. If you could think 
of an example--name the judge, if you wish--of a demonstration 
of good temperament in a case that you&#x27;ve been involved in, in 
a court, I&#x27;d like--wish you&#x27;d share it with us. Ms. Elliott?
    Ms. Elliott. Thank you, Chair Durbin. You&#x27;re putting me on 
the spot, to ask me to select only one judge. I&#x27;ve had the good 
fortune of practicing in New Hampshire in both State and 
Federal courts, over the course of 15 years and hundreds of 
clients, and I&#x27;ve appeared before a number of judges. I think 
the most important qualities that I&#x27;ve seen in a judge, for 
temperament, are humility and humanity: humility, to understand 
their limited role and to set aside their personal views, and 
humanity, to treat all parties who appear before them equally. 
There are some judges--many judges in the Federal court that I 
could name, but I think you&#x27;ll understand that I don&#x27;t want to 
name any of them right now. I don&#x27;t want to----
    Chair Durbin. Not at this point.
    Ms. Elliott [continuing]. Single anyone out. But I can name 
one person you probably--you wouldn&#x27;t have heard of, but there 
was a Superior Court Judge in New Hampshire named Kenny McHugh. 
He&#x27;s since been retired. Every person who appeared in his court 
knew they were welcome there. He didn&#x27;t stand on formality, and 
his biggest aim was to make sure that the parties understood 
what was going on and could explain their case to the judge. 
They had that opportunity to explain their case to the judge in 
whatever words worked for them, and he would take it seriously. 
I think that that&#x27;s the inspiration that I would hope to follow 
if I had the honor of being confirmed.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks. Judge Lopez.
    Judge Lopez. Thank you, Chairman Durbin. I have to agree 
with just about everything Ms. Elliott said, and I would add 
that I have found, being--as a sitting judge, now, that walking 
into that courtroom with patience and being willing to listen 
to the arguments is something that all parties appreciate. 
Every day, there&#x27;s someone who walks in court--it might be my 
job, but it is their big day in court, and as long as they feel 
that the judge is attentive and listening and patient, that 
person feels like they had their fair day in court.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you. Judge Menendez.
    Judge Menendez. Thank you, Senator. Having appeared in 
front of so many judges over and over again, I&#x27;ve seen them 
show great compassion and patience and evenhandedness in 
difficult circumstances, and I&#x27;ve taken lessons from each of 
the judges that I&#x27;ve appeared in front of. I&#x27;d also briefly 
name the judge that I clerked for, a judge on the Fourth 
Circuit who has passed away, Sam Ervin. He was one of the most 
humble people I ever met, and he really embodied the idea of 
never to get too big for your britches, and I hope that I have 
brought that same humility to the bench. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you. Judge Ohta.
    Judge Ohta. Thank you. I&#x27;ve already mentioned Judge 
Moskowitz, who has been my mentor and my example for so many 
things. As his clerk, I saw firsthand just how kindly, with 
humility, with generosity of spirit that he treated every 
single person that appeared in his courtroom, and every day as 
a sitting judge I seek to emulate him.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you. Mr. Urias.
    Mr. Urias. Thank you, Chairman Durbin. I would say that, as 
far as temperament is concerned, I think I started learning 
that about judges, and how important it is to have a good 
temperament when you are a judge, when I clerked for Judge Ruiz 
here in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. That 
continued on throughout my career. I&#x27;ve practiced in Federal 
courts in Northern District of Texas and the Southern District 
of Texas and Arizona and New Mexico, and I&#x27;ve had the honor and 
privilege to be able to say that all of the judges that I&#x27;ve 
appeared before have had very good judicial temperament, and 
that made a world of difference in some of the controversial 
and complicated cases that we brought back then.
    One individual, in addition to all of the court--district 
judges in New Mexico, who all have been just excellent judges, 
in my view, as far as temperament and the way they handle their 
courtroom, one example that I can speak to by name would be 
Judge John Roll of the U.S. District Court in Arizona. Judge 
Roll was shot and killed not long after our trial in front of 
him, at the same time that one of the Members of the House of 
Representatives was shot and killed in Arizona, or not shot and 
killed but shot and injured in Arizona. Judge Roll was a man 
who had been known to be a very conservative judge, and we were 
bringing a civil rights case in front of him, and there were 
some very controversial and complicated issues that he had to 
decide, and I think he really exemplified what it means to be a 
judge with good judicial temperament and be fair and impartial, 
so I have always sort of looked to him for an example of that.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you for honoring his memory today, too. 
Senator Grassley.
    Senator Grassley. Congratulations, all of you. We were 
voting, so I didn&#x27;t get a chance to hear from you personally. I 
apologize for that. I&#x27;m going to start with Mr. Urias. You 
urged the New Mexico Supreme Court to prohibit Federal law 
enforcement agencies from enforcing immigration laws in and 
around the State courthouses. You have also argued against 
efforts by New Mexico State officials to prohibit foreign drug 
traffickers from getting driver&#x27;s licenses. In 2017, you also 
commended Santa Fe&#x27;s decision to pass sanctuary city 
legislation. These questions probably wouldn&#x27;t be asked of you 
if you weren&#x27;t going to be on the court and have to be an 
impartial judge. Given these positions, can you assure us that, 
if confirmed, you will uphold Federal law and serve with 
impartiality?
    Mr. Urias. Thank you for the question, Senator. Absolutely, 
yes, whatever positions I took as an advocate were taken as an 
advocate on behalf of my clients, and I see the distinction--
there could not be something more distinct than the role of a--
between a judge and an advocate. As a judge, my goal and what I 
would hopefully try to do throughout my career is to look at 
every case fairly and impartially and diligently apply the law 
to the facts of every case.
    Senator Grassley. Okay. You&#x27;re also--good for you, sir.
    Mr. Urias. Yes.
    Senator Grassley. You also criticized efforts by the New 
Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department to stop tax fraud by 
illegal immigrants. The Government challenged thousands of tax 
returns between 2012 and 2014. This was part of an effort to 
combat illegal immigrants seeking tax refunds using fraudulent 
Social Security numbers. You suggested that the Government&#x27;s 
effort to audit tax returns and prevent fraud was quote, ``an 
act of swindlers, not an act of legitimate State government,&#x27;&#x27; 
end quote. I&#x27;d like kind of an explanation of why you described 
those efforts to protect taxpayers that way.
    Mr. Urias. Thank you for that question, as well, Senator. 
Actually, that case involved--what we were asserting in that 
case on behalf of our clients, that was done also as a lawyer 
who was advocating on behalf of some State Senators who were 
challenging that law, as well as some permanent legal residents 
who were caught up in this very broad law that was directed at, 
not immigration or immigrants, but directed on people based on 
their national origin. The State court in that case rightfully 
applied strict scrutiny and struck that down almost immediately 
after that.
    I will say that we worked diligently with the opposing side 
on the tax refund cases to--on the--those are on the 
recertification program cases that you referenced. With regard 
to the tax refund cases, we also asserted claims on behalf of 
our clients, and that had to do with the fact that the Federal 
Government provides people who do not have Social Security 
numbers a way to file their taxes, using ITIN numbers. In that 
case, what was occurring in New Mexico wasn&#x27;t occurring 
anywhere else in the country and wasn&#x27;t done by the IRS itself, 
and that was withholding tax refunds without a legal basis. We 
asserted claims on their behalf. We, thankfully, were able to 
resolve that case with the State of New Mexico, and they 
corrected their ways and understood the way the Federal law had 
been set up, so that everyone who works in New Mexico and who 
pays taxes are eligible for a refund.
    Senator Grassley. This will have to be my last question, so 
for the rest of you, you&#x27;ll get questions from me in writing.
    Again to you, sir, as a member of the Legal Panel, you 
advised the ACLU on cases and litigation strategy. 2017, ACLU 
of New Mexico represented a woman who styled herself as, quote 
unquote, ``the high priestess of local Wiccan coven.&#x27;&#x27; In a 
lawsuit against a town in New Mexico, the lawsuit argued that 
private citizens had no right to erect a monument of Ten 
Commandments in front of the city hall because the high 
priestess believed doing so would make her a second-class 
citizen. Do you still believe that private citizens have no 
right to raise money to display the Ten Commandments if it 
would offend a witch?
    Mr. Urias. Senator, I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m familiar with that 
case. It probably--if I&#x27;m correct on what you are referring, it 
was something that was brought before I was a member of the 
Legal Panel.
    Senator Grassley. Let me make it easy for you. If you----
    Mr. Urias. Sure.
    Senator Grassley [continuing]. Aren&#x27;t familiar with it, 
you----
    Mr. Urias. Yes.
    Senator Grassley [continuing]. Can answer that question in 
writing.
    Mr. Urias. Sounds good, Senator. Thank you.
    Senator Grassley. I congratulate all of you.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Klobuchar.
    Senator Klobuchar. Very good. Thank you very much, Mr. 
Chair and Senator Grassley. Thank you to all of you. I was 
thinking, as I heard Mr. Urias, about your mother at home, that 
there&#x27;s a few Senators that have trouble getting online, as 
well, so don&#x27;t--hopefully she&#x27;s on by now. I&#x27;m going to focus, 
with all respect to everyone else, on my home State nominee, 
here, Judge Menendez.
    Since 2016, Judge, you&#x27;ve served as magistrate for the 
District of Minnesota, a position you were selected for by our 
Federal district court judges, who have different judicial 
philosophies, I would say, and as far as I know, every one of 
you--them has deep respect for you. How has your experience as 
a magistrate judge informed your view on the role of a Federal 
district court judge?
    Judge Menendez. Thank you for that question, Senator. I 
have had the privilege of appearing in front of this same 
district court over and over again, and as a magistrate judge, 
I try to act with appropriate judicial temperament and decorum, 
always applying binding authority to the facts of the case 
before me, following Supreme Court precedent and Eighth Circuit 
precedent, also trying to make sure that every litigant that 
comes before me and every lawyer that comes before me will be--
will feel heard and that I will be prepared to issue an 
appropriate ruling in the case. I think those same skills are 
called for if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed to the 
district court bench.
    Senator Klobuchar. Very good. Your decisions--I think one 
of the reasons that you&#x27;re popular there is that your decisions 
are reviewed by Minnesota&#x27;s Federal district court judges--I 
think you&#x27;ve heard over 425 different cases, and that includes 
judges nominated by Presidents Ford, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, 
Obama, and Trump--and your decisions have been adopted in full 
approximately 97 percent of the time. How do you typically 
approach a new case, and why do you think these decisions have 
been adopted by the Federal district court?
    Judge Menendez. Thank you, Senator. Every time a new case 
arises before me, I try to be extremely prepared to hear 
arguments if there are oral arguments, and then I apply binding 
precedent. It actually is very often the case that the answers 
are easy, because the authority directly on point applies very 
cleanly to the facts before me.
    I also strive to write very thorough but clear opinions 
that are well organized and can be understood, not just by the 
parties before me and not just by lawyers, but by regular 
people who might read those opinions to see about the way I&#x27;m 
applying the law. I think that that has led to my reports and 
recommendations and orders being consistently affirmed by the 
district court and sometimes by the Eighth Circuit Court of 
Appeals.
    Senator Klobuchar. Okay. Thank you. Before joining the 
bench, you served for nearly 20 years, helping to represent 
those who could not afford an attorney. During that time, you 
worked on hundreds of cases, including one which brought you to 
the Supreme Court twice for oral arguments. With an 8-1 
decision written by Justice Scalia, the Court ruled in your 
client&#x27;s favor. How were you able to convince Justice Scalia 
and the majority of the other justices to rule in favor of your 
client?
    Judge Menendez. Thank you, Senator. Until today, that was 
actually the scariest thing I&#x27;d ever done. I just endeavored to 
be very prepared and to do my best on behalf of the individual 
client that I was representing, to advocate effectively to the 
Supreme Court. Justice Scalia and the other Justices of the 
Court, I think, found our position to be the appropriate one in 
light of the law and issued the decision, but I simply did my 
very best to be as prepared as possible.
    Senator Klobuchar. All right. Thank you very much, and 
thank you to all of you.
    Judge Menendez. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Judge Menendez. We do our best to 
make this the scariest moment in everyone&#x27;s life who appears 
before us. Senator Hawley, following in that tradition?
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Hawley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I&#x27;ll take that as 
a compliment. Judge Ohta, if I could start with you, let me ask 
you about some of the comments made by the Lawyers Club of San 
Diego. I just want to be sure, before I do that--you&#x27;ve been 
involved extensively with that organization, is that right? Do 
I have that right?
    Judge Ohta. Senator Hawley, I was a member of the 15-member 
board of directors for the Lawyers Club of San Diego, which is 
a local bar association in San Diego that deals with women&#x27;s 
issues, but I have stepped away from that board when I became a 
sitting judge, just as I&#x27;ve stepped away from all advocacy. 
Now, in my courtroom, I decide all the cases that come before 
me on the facts and the law only, without regard to previous 
advocacy positions.
    Senator Hawley. Okay, got it. Thank you. Let me just ask 
you about some of the comments, some of the statements that the 
Lawyers Club has made. In a 2020 press release, the Lawyers 
Club blasted the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Little Sisters 
of the Poor. That press release said that the decision was, and 
I&#x27;m quoting them now, ``a devastating blow to women&#x27;s 
reproductive justice,&#x27;&#x27; end quote, and that the decision 
``perpetuates inequality.&#x27;&#x27; That&#x27;s a quote. Can you explain to 
me why protecting the religious freedom of this case of a 
women&#x27;s group is a devastating blow to women? I mean, tell me 
the logic behind that statement.
    Judge Ohta. Okay. Thank you, Senator. The 15-member board 
of directors of the Lawyers Club of San Diego issued that 
statement expressing concern about decreased access to 
contraceptive care for women; however, as a sitting judge right 
now, I&#x27;ve set aside all previous advocacy, just as I&#x27;ve walked 
away from the board, and any cases that come before me----
    Senator Hawley. I don&#x27;t--I&#x27;m sorry to interrupt you. Our 
time is really limited. Were you a member of the organization, 
though, at that time, in 2020?
    Judge Ohta. Yes, I was a member of the 15-member board of 
directors----
    Senator Hawley. That issued----
    Judge Ohta [continuing]. Before----
    Senator Hawley [continuing]. The press release? Okay. You 
issued the press release. You signed off on it. I want to ask 
you about that, since it&#x27;s a statement you signed. Tell me why 
the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in this case, protecting the 
group--the rights of a female religious group, a Catholic order 
of nuns, is a devastating blow to women. I want to understand 
that statement, for the record, so explain that for me.
    Judge Ohta. Thank you, Senator. That statement, again, 
expressed concern about decreased access for women to 
contraceptive care; however, I----
    Senator Hawley. Do you stand by it?
    Judge Ohta. Senator, I regret the extent to which the 
wording of that statement may give the impression that I would 
not take religious liberty very seriously in my courtroom. It 
is a foundational right and one that&#x27;s enshrined in our Bill of 
Rights, and----
    Senator Hawley. Can I just ask you----
    Judge Ohta [continuing]. In my----
    Senator Hawley. Do you think the--I&#x27;m sorry, I&#x27;ve just got 
two minutes here, and I don&#x27;t want to get you--I want to allow 
you to explain your views on this case. Do you think that--
clearly, you thought this decision was wrongly decided, but 
why? Why is the Supreme Court decision here, protecting the 
rights of this female religious group, wrong?
    Judge Ohta. Again, Senator that was a statement that was 
issued by the Lawyers Club of San Diego before I was a sitting 
judge.
    Senator Hawley. You signed a--we&#x27;ve been over that. Just 
tell me why you think it was--I mean, these are statements 
you&#x27;ve made, now, so tell me why you think that the Supreme 
Court decision protecting the rights of this women&#x27;s order of 
Catholic nuns was wrongly decided?
    Judge Ohta. As a sitting judge, Senator Hawley, and as a 
nominee, I would faithfully, fully follow all----
    Senator Hawley. Yes, but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m asking you.
    Judge Ohta [continuing]. Applicable----
    Senator Hawley. I&#x27;m asking about your statements that you 
made. Recently, I might add. This wasn&#x27;t an eternity ago. This 
was recent. These are cases that are from the U.S. Supreme 
Court, you&#x27;ve criticized very sharply, I think it&#x27;s fair to 
say. Explain to me why you think it was wrong, this outcome in 
this case, and why you criticized it so sharply.
    Judge Ohta. Senator, what would happen in my courtroom is 
that I would faithfully apply Supreme Court precedent----
    Senator Hawley. Are you not going to answer my question?
    Judge Ohta [continuing]. Without----
    Senator Hawley. It sounds like to me. Is this a--you&#x27;re 
declining to answer? You&#x27;re not going to say why you issued 
this statement, why you think the case was wrong?
    Judge Ohta. Senator, I am here to assure you that that 
precedent, as well as all Supreme Court precedent, would be 
faithfully followed by me in the courtroom without regard to 
any previous advocacy statements that----
    Senator Hawley. Let me try something else. Was Brown v. 
Board rightly decided?
    Judge Ohta. Senator, in general, as a nominee, I would 
decline to comment on the merits of Supreme Court cases, the 
parameters or the issues that are still coming before the 
courts. However, I do make an exception for cases like Brown v. 
Board of Education, which dealt with de jure racial 
segregation, and cases like Marbury v. Madison, because those 
issues are unlikely to come before me. Yes, Senator, Brown v. 
Board of Education was correctly decided.
    Senator Hawley. Okay. My time is expired, and I need to let 
my colleagues question. I&#x27;ll have some more questions for the 
record.
    I just want to put a marker down here to say that when 
you&#x27;ve made statements on the record directly criticizing 
Supreme Court cases, in very sharp terms, I might add, I think 
you need to be prepared to explain why you&#x27;ve done that. I&#x27;m 
not asking you to comment on hypotheticals. I&#x27;m asking you to 
comment on your own statements on law that, frankly, you&#x27;ll be 
called upon to apply, and your refusal to do so to repeatedly 
answer my questions here today, I think, is disturbing, 
considering you chose to make these statements, and they&#x27;re 
very recent statements, and they directly affect your ability 
to do the job that you&#x27;re being asked to do. So, that gives me 
a lot of pause. I&#x27;ll have some more questions for you, for the 
record. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Blackburn.
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Urias, I 
want to come to you. Sanctuary cities. When the Santa Fe City 
Council passed a resolution prohibiting local authorities from 
sharing information, immigration information, with the Federal 
Government, you praised this policy as a way for cities to use, 
and I quote, ``local resources against threats from the Federal 
Government,&#x27;&#x27; end quote. Why is the Federal enforcement of our 
Nation&#x27;s immigration law, duly enacted law, a threat?
    Mr. Urias. Thank you, Senator Blackburn. I&#x27;m not sure I 
recall that quote. It&#x27;s not something that I----
    Senator Blackburn. Well, then, why----
    Mr. Urias [continuing]. Remember saying.
    Senator Blackburn [continuing]. Don&#x27;t you look it up? 
Because you&#x27;re on the record, having said that. We&#x27;ll be happy 
to give you that quote and the context, and then we&#x27;ll expect a 
written response from you on that, because it&#x27;s disturbing that 
someone who wants to be on the Federal bench is going to issue 
a statement calling the laws of this country, the duly enacted 
laws, a threat by the Federal Government.
    Yes or no? Do you believe that State and Federal 
partnerships are an unholy alliance? Yes or no?
    Mr. Urias. I do not think that they&#x27;re unholy alliance.
    Senator Blackburn. You don&#x27;t?
    Mr. Urias. No.
    Senator Blackburn. Okay. Yes or no, do you believe that 
those who seek to protect unborn children are committing acts 
of violence? Yes or no?
    Mr. Urias. Senator, I would decline to answer that, only 
because those are issues that are still viable----
    Senator Blackburn. Okay. No, that&#x27;s----
    Mr. Urias [continuing]. In the court----
    Senator Blackburn [continuing]. A position. You have served 
on the Legal Panel of the ACLU of New Mexico since 2016, which 
holds those views. Among other radical positions, this 
organization has expressed hostile views of conservatives--
that&#x27;s people like me--accusing the Trump administration of 
racism and white supremacy. Do you support and share the views 
of your organization?
    Mr. Urias. Senator, I have never been a member of the board 
of directors of the ACLU in New Mexico. What I am, just for 
clarification, is--I was----
    Senator Blackburn. You&#x27;ve been on the Legal Panel. I said 
the Legal Panel.
    Mr. Urias. Yes, ma&#x27;am. I was asked about four years ago to 
be part of a Legal Panel which was a group of people comprised 
of professors, law professors, members----
    Senator Blackburn. Yes.
    Mr. Urias [continuing]. Of the----
    Senator Blackburn. I understand----
    Mr. Urias [continuing]. Disciplinary board----
    Senator Blackburn [continuing]. What it is.
    Mr. Urias. All right.
    Senator Blackburn. I&#x27;m asking--and so you can submit for 
us--if you abide by those statements of the ACLU, as you served 
on their Legal Panel.
    Judge Menendez, during your investiture in 2016, you 
delivered a speech where you discussed doing justice while on 
the bench. During this speech, you made comments that suggest 
you believe judges should be engaged in advocacy. I&#x27;m quoting 
you, here, ``I&#x27;m also learning that doing justice permits me to 
give weight to my unique experience but does not allow them to 
dictate my decisions or--as perhaps they used to do, and doing 
justice mandates that I follow the law as it is, not just as I 
wish it were, something that isn&#x27;t always easy.&#x27;&#x27;
    In December of that year, you also delivered a speech at 
the Federal Bar Association luncheon at the Minneapolis Club. 
In it, you said, ``It is so much less clear how to advocate for 
equal justice, now that I am on the bench. I&#x27;m still learning 
how to use my new role to be an advocate for fairness while 
being impartial and still learning when, and to what extent, 
seeking fairness is even my job.&#x27;&#x27; What is the role of a judge? 
Is it to impartially apply the law, or is it to be an advocate 
for fairness as you perceive fairness to be?
    Judge Menendez. Thank you for that question, Senator. The 
role of a judge is not to be an advocate. It&#x27;s to fairly apply 
the precedent and the law to the cases that come before me. In 
the courthouse where I&#x27;ve worked my entire career, ``Equal 
Justice Under Law&#x27;&#x27; is emblazoned----
    Senator Blackburn. Okay.
    Judge Menendez [continuing]. In big letters.
    Senator Blackburn. Let me just say, I have to move on, but 
it is of concern that you would seek to use your position on 
the bench as an advocate.
    Judge Lopez, on one occasion you represented a defendant 
accused of attempting to re-enter the country illegally after 
being deported. You argued that it was a reversible error for a 
trial court to instruct grand jurors to follow the law even if 
they disagreed with it. Do you believe that a juror may simply 
decline to indict an otherwise guilty defendant simply because 
the juror doesn&#x27;t think the particular conduct at issue should 
be criminalized?
    Judge Lopez. Thank you, Senator Blackburn. I&#x27;m not 
recollecting the case that you&#x27;re referring to; however----
    Senator Blackburn. We&#x27;ll----
    Judge Lopez [continuing]. I----
    Senator Blackburn. We will provide that to you, so that you 
can give us a written response.
    Do you think that a judge can simply disregard applicable 
laws if they disagree with those laws?
    Judge Lopez. Under no circumstances, Senator Blackburn.
    Senator Blackburn. Under no circumstances. Okay, thank you.
    Judge Ohta, I--my time has expired, but I am going to come 
to you on this issue of Little Sisters of the Poor for a 
written response, because your response that you gave to 
Senator Hawley is insufficient, and we would like to get a 
little bit more clarity around that. Religious liberty is a 
bedrock of our Nation, and it is important, and so we need some 
more clarity from you. Thank you all.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Blackburn. Senator 
Klobuchar.
    Senator Klobuchar. Yes. While Senator Blackburn&#x27;s still 
here, I just wanted to--Judge Menendez--I had a minute left 
from my original questioning, and I just want to again 
emphasize how you have heard over 425 different cases as a 
magistrate. Your decisions have been adopted 97 percent of the 
time by judges appointed by President Trump, by judges 
appointed by President Reagan. Could you talk about--you were 
an advocate, of course; you represented clients, like most 
lawyers do in their careers, that become judges--how you 
differentiate that from your role as a magistrate and what I 
believe will be as a judge?
    Judge Menendez. Thank you, Senator, for that question. From 
the moment I took the bench, I was actually somewhat surprised 
at how easy it was to leave behind my role as an advocate and 
to assume the role of judge, where I have to decide the cases 
before me based on the facts and the law. Positions that I took 
as an advocate, my personal beliefs--those things play--and can 
play no role in the decisions I make as a judge.
    Senator Klobuchar. Again, just for the record, I have 
talked to a number of our conservative judges who are strong 
supporters of Judge Menendez. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. We&#x27;re on a 
second roll call on the floor. The only other Senator seeking 
recognition is Senator Cruz, and we&#x27;re--and Senator Padilla, so 
I&#x27;m hoping we can still make the roll call. Senator Cruz.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome, to each of 
the nominees. Ms. Elliott, when you were endorsing John 
Curran&#x27;s nomination to the New Hampshire Circuit Court, you 
stated that Curran quote, ``reads the people, he reads the 
facts. He&#x27;s not overly focused on the law, and he understands 
what the jury might be thinking about. Those same qualities 
that make him an incredible trial lawyer will make him a 
fantastic judge.&#x27;&#x27; Why do you think it is a beneficial trait in 
a judge to not be, as you put it, ``overly focused on the 
law&#x27;&#x27;?
    Ms. Elliott. Thank you for the question, Senator Cruz. I 
have to say at the outset that that is not what I intended to 
say, and so I apologize if it&#x27;s giving the impression that I 
don&#x27;t think judges need to follow the law. If I were given the 
honor of a confirmation, obviously I would follow the precedent 
faithfully and without any bias.
    What I intended to say about John Curran, who was then my 
law partner and is now on the Circuit Court in New Hampshire, 
is that he is not overly formal. I didn&#x27;t mean to suggest that 
he doesn&#x27;t follow the law. It&#x27;s that he doesn&#x27;t--there are two 
different types of trial lawyers, as I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve seen, and 
some are focused very much so on explaining the law in a dry, 
kind of borderline pedantic way, and attorney--then-attorney 
Curran was really much more about connecting with the judge and 
the jury and the parties in the courtroom, and I thought that, 
given what he was nominated to be, which is a circuit court 
judge doing, you know, small claims and misdemeanor cases, that 
his ability to connect with the parties in the courtroom would 
be an asset to the bench.
    Senator Cruz. Okay. Thank you. Judge Lopez, before joining 
the bench, you represented an illegal alien who had re-entered 
the country after being deported, and you argued that it was 
reversible error for the trial court to instruct grand jurors 
to follow the law even if they disagree with it. As a judge, 
will you instruct jurors and grand jurors to follow the law, 
even if they disagree with it?
    Judge Lopez. Thank you, Senator Cruz, for that question. 
Absolutely, I will.
    Senator Cruz. Why, then, did you argue it was reversible 
error to do that?
    Judge Lopez. Senator Cruz, I don&#x27;t recall that case. I 
don&#x27;t recall making that argument. As I sit here now, I would 
not be able to speak to the facts of that case. I can assure 
you that if I&#x27;m fortunate enough to be confirmed, I would do 
what I&#x27;ve done over the past three years as a magistrate judge, 
which is to faithfully apply the law, and I would instruct 
jurors to do the same.
    Senator Cruz. Judge Menendez, during your investiture in 
2016, you delivered a speech discussing your judicial 
philosophy. You stated, ``I was hoping by now I would have the 
beginnings of a judicial philosophy, a simple mantra that could 
help me do this new and difficult job. No such luck, but the 
verse from Micah that my mom referenced in her invocation is 
one I keep in my head, maybe because I hear my pastor say it so 
often. &#x27;Do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly&#x27;--good advice 
for a judge.&#x27;&#x27; Judge, now that you&#x27;ve been on the bench for 
five years, how would you describe your judicial philosophy?
    Judge Menendez. Thank you for that question, Senator. I 
think it&#x27;s important, first and foremost, for a judge to apply 
the law, regardless of their opinions about it, squarely to the 
facts in the cases that come before them, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve 
endeavored to do at every turn, Senator. I would also say that 
it is important that the parties that come before me feel that 
they are heard, that I am impartial, and that I am always 
prepared. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve got a mantra yet, but I am very 
aware of the role of a judge and the importance of applying 
precedent.
    Senator Cruz. Judge Ohta, you were actively involved with 
the Lawyers Club, as you co-chaired the Reproductive Justice 
and Women&#x27;s Advocacy Committee and the Diverse Women&#x27;s 
Committee, and you wrote several articles for the organization. 
In a 2020 press release, the Lawyers Club criticized the U.S. 
Supreme Court decision in Little Sisters of the Poor v. 
Pennsylvania. The press release said that the decision to allow 
religious and moral exemptions to the contraception mandate in 
the Affordable Care Act was a quote, ``devastating blow to 
women&#x27;s reproductive justice, and the decision perpetuates 
inequality.&#x27;&#x27; Do you believe that Supreme Court precedent 
upholding conscience protections and religious or moral 
exemptions are legitimate and binding on you as a judge?
    Judge Ohta. Senator, thank you for the question. I take the 
First Amendment rights to free exercise of religious liberty 
very seriously. It is a foundational right. It&#x27;s one that&#x27;s 
enshrined in the Bill of Rights, and if that issue were to come 
before me in the courtroom, I would give it the due respect 
that it is owed. I would faithfully apply all Supreme Court 
precedent, and I would decide the case before me on the 
precedent and the facts, without regard to previous advocacy 
positions, without regard to any personal or political beliefs 
that I may have on the issue.
    Senator Cruz. Did you agree with the Lawyers Club press 
release blasting the Supreme Court&#x27;s Little Sisters of the Poor 
decision?
    Judge Ohta. Senator, the 15-member board of directors of 
the Lawyers Club of San Diego released that statement. I was on 
the board of directors at that time.
    Senator Cruz. Did you agree with it?
    Judge Ohta. Senator, that press release issued by the 
Lawyers Club of San Diego was before I became a sitting judge. 
Currently, as a sitting judge----
    Senator Cruz. At the time it issued, did you agree with it? 
That&#x27;s a yes or no. You either agreed with it or you disagreed 
with it.
    Judge Ohta. Senator, currently, as a sitting judge, I make 
my decisions----
    Senator Cruz. I&#x27;m asking at the time the press release went 
out, not today.
    Judge Ohta. Senator, at the time that the press release 
went out, I was on the board of directors of the Lawyers Club 
of San Diego that voted to release that press release; 
however----
    Senator Cruz. Did you agree with it? Did you vote to 
release it?
    Judge Ohta. Yes, I voted to release it; however, as a 
sitting judge, my personal views, any previous advocacy 
statements don&#x27;t enter into my courtroom. That would be 
inappropriate and a violation of the judicial oath that I take 
very seriously as a sitting judge.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Padilla.
    Senator Padilla. Thank you, Mr. Chair. First question is 
for Judge Ohta. Over the course of a 20-year legal career, 
you&#x27;ve had the distinguished opportunities to work for judges, 
to advocate for the State on behalf of consumers, to represent 
corporate clients, to teach law students as a visiting 
professor, and, most recently, to serve as a judge yourself. 
Taken all together, you&#x27;ve had a wide exposure to different 
facets of the law and the legal profession. My question is, how 
will these diverse legal experiences contribute to the way you 
approach your work as a Federal district court judge?
    Judge Ohta. Thank you for the question, Senator Padilla. I 
started my legal career not as an advocate but clerking for 
Judge Barry Ted Moskowitz in the Southern District of 
California. From day one, I learned what it means to set aside 
personal beliefs, political preferences, and concentrate on the 
law and the facts only and engage in that most important 
function of neutral and evenhanded adjudication. As an 
advocate, I zealously represented the people of the State of 
California, as well as corporation defendants in labor and 
employment cases, but when I took the oath to become a State 
court judge, I returned to doing what I learned to do from the 
very outset of my career, which is to set aside any personal 
beliefs, political preferences, and decide each case that come 
before me on the facts and the law only.
    Senator Padilla. Okay. Thank you very much. You anticipated 
the follow-up question, which was exactly that, what role a 
judge&#x27;s personal policy preference may play in the evaluation 
of the merits of a case before he--him or her. I appreciate the 
answer. I know it&#x27;s a very specific question and a concern for 
a lot of Members of the Committee, and I believe the way you&#x27;ve 
answered should address any questions or concerns about that.
    Mr. Urias, you&#x27;ve been asked about your personal views and 
your prior advocacy, as well, so let me pose the same question 
to you. What role should a judge&#x27;s personal policy play in the 
evaluation in the merits of a case before them?
    Mr. Urias. Thank you, Senator. Personal views should never 
have a place in looking at the cases that are before a judge, 
so I would never let my personal views or any other views that 
I might have expressed as an advocate come into play when I&#x27;m a 
Federal judge.
    Senator Padilla. Okay. Thank you. Ms. Lopez, public 
defenders play a critical role in our system of justice, 
functioning as guardians of due process. They serve to ensure 
that all criminal defendants, regardless of their stature in 
life or ability to pay, are afforded reasoned counsel and 
advocacy as the power of the State is brought to bear against 
them. They put the Government to its proof and, in so doing, 
defend not only individuals but our constitutional system of 
government itself.
    Before becoming a Federal magistrate judge, you served for 
about 11 years as a public defender, and before that you worked 
in private practice. Why did you choose to become a public 
defender, and what--how has that experience--what does that 
experience afford you to bring to the bench, if confirmed?
    Judge Lopez. Thank you, Senator Padilla, for that question. 
The ability to assist individuals charged with offenses by 
adhering to the constitutional rights under the Sixth Amendment 
was something that was very--it was a driving force for me. The 
ability to represent individuals, making certain that their 
rights were met, was something that was a very rewarding 
experience for me and where I spent about 20 years of my life. 
What it taught me was the importance and the necessity to treat 
everyone in the judicial system with fairness, with an open 
mind, and with civility. As an advocate, I utilized those tools 
in treating--in dealing with opposing counsel as well as with 
the judges in my case, dealing with probation officers and 
pretrial services officers and family members and everyone that 
was a part of the equation. Those are the same tools that I 
brought with me to the magistrate judge bench, the importance 
of the rule that everyone plays, not just the defense attorney 
but everyone. That has served me well, and those are skills 
that I will bring with me if fortunate enough to be confirmed.
    Senator Padilla. Okay. Thank you for your response. Mr. 
Chair, I&#x27;d like to enter into the record a letter endorsing 
Judge Lopez&#x27;s nomination submitted by a number of Federal 
prosecutors. The letter demonstrates the wide respect that the 
legal community has for Judge Lopez&#x27;s intellect, 
evenhandedness, and commitment to the rule of law.
    Chair Durbin. Without objection.
    Senator Padilla. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you very much, Senator Padilla. Thank 
you to this panel. This is probably the closest you&#x27;re going to 
come to reliving the law school experience, which I look back 
with fond memories. I would also say to you that there may be 
questions sent your way in writing. That&#x27;s been suggested by 
several of the Members here. We&#x27;re asking those who are doing 
that to do so by 5 p.m. on Wednesday, November 10th. Your--is 
that the answers?
    [Speaker in the room.] That&#x27;s when the questions are due.
    Chair Durbin. Questions are due. We ask that you respond in 
a timely fashion, as quickly as you can.
    Before I adjourn, I will just tell you, for what it&#x27;s 
worth, one of my favorite Abraham Lincoln quotes. Of course, he 
was in the political fracas most of his life, and he was 
accused by one of his opponents of changing his position on an 
issue. Lincoln said, ``It&#x27;s true. And I&#x27;ve decided I&#x27;d rather 
be right some of the time than wrong all the time.&#x27;&#x27; I&#x27;ve used 
that, if you can imagine, very many times. I want to thank you 
all for coming here today, and the Senate Judiciary Committee 
will stand adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 12:20 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
