                      TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 2021

                              United States Senate,
                                Committee on the Judiciary,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:02 a.m., in 
Room 226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Richard J. 
Durbin, Chair of the Committee, presiding.
    Present: Senators Durbin [presiding], Leahy, Feinstein, 
Klobuchar, Blumenthal, Hirono, Padilla, Ossoff, Grassley, 
Cornyn, Lee, Cruz, Hawley, Cotton, Kennedy, Tillis, and 
Blackburn.
    Also present: Senators Wyden, Sanders, Merkley, Manchin, 
and Capito.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD J. DURBIN,

           A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS

    Chair Durbin. This hearing will come to order.
    Today we hear from four nominees: Justice Ruth--pardon me, 
Beth Robinson, nominated to the Second Circuit; Jennifer Sung, 
nominated to the Ninth Circuit; Dr. Rahul Gupta, nominated to 
head the Office of National Drug Control Policy; Elizabeth 
Prelogar, nominated to serve as Solicitor General of the United 
States.
    With today&#x27;s slate, the Biden administration and Senate 
Democrats are advancing nominees, well-qualified, who bring 
important professional and demographic diversity. I&#x27;d like to 
note several historic firsts among today&#x27;s nominees. Upon 
confirmation, Justice Robinson will be the first openly LGBTQ 
woman on an appellate court. Ms. Sung will be the first Asian-
American woman to occupy one of Oregon&#x27;s Ninth Circuit seats. 
Dr. Gupta will be the first medical doctor to head ONDCP.
    A number of our colleagues will introduce our two judicial 
nominees and Dr. Gupta. I have the privilege of introducing the 
nominee to serve as our Nation&#x27;s next Solicitor General.
    Elizabeth Prelogar is, without a doubt, one of the most 
accomplished appellate litigators to have been nominated to 
serve in this position. She has argued nine cases before the 
Supreme Court, submitted cert petitions, merit briefs, amicus 
briefs, and hundreds of additional cases. Outstanding choice, 
frequently referred to as--for a position, frequently referred 
to as ``the tenth Justice.&#x27;&#x27;
    Born in Boise, Idaho, Ms. Prelogar graduated summa cum 
laude from Emory University before earning her master&#x27;s in 
literature from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. She 
then went on to serve--pardon me to earn her J.D. magna cum 
laude from the Harvard Law School. After clerking for then 
Judge Merrick Garland, and twice clerking on the Supreme Court, 
once for the late Justice Ginsburg, and once for Justice Kagan, 
Ms. Prelogar began a career as an appellate attorney. Initially 
joining the appellate practice at Hogan Lovells, Ms. Prelogar 
has spent five years as a career attorney in the Department of 
Justice as an Assistant to the Solicitor General and an 
Assistant Special Counsel in the Office of Special Counsel.
    Ms. Prelogar worked for both Democratic and Republican 
Presidents and came to develop a profound tradition--pardon me, 
a profound appreciation for the traditions and practices of the 
Office of Solicitor General.
    After returning to private practice at Cooley LLP, Ms. 
Prelogar was chosen to serve as the Biden administration&#x27;s 
Acting Solicitor General, a role she held from January 2021 
until her nomination last month.
    Two brief observations about her career. First, having 
served under both Democratic and Republican administrations, in 
both career and political roles, Ms. Prelogar not only has an 
unwavering commitment to provide unbiased legal advice, but 
understands the critical role that career attorneys play within 
the Department. Second, having served in the Justice Department 
during the Trump administration, she demonstrated her ability 
to advance legal arguments irrespective of her own personal or 
political belief.
    Given her experience and her reputation as a principled, 
outstanding advocate, it&#x27;s little surprise that Ms. Prelogar 
has broad bipartisan support. The Committee has received 
letters from 12 former Senate-confirmed and Acting Solicitor 
Generals from the George Bush--George H.W. Bush, Clinton, 
George W. Bush, Obama, and Trump administration. They include 
Solicitors General Ted Olson, Paul Clement, and Noel Francisco, 
among others.
    These 12 former Solicitors General wrote, ``Elizabeth&#x27;s 
prior experience in the Office give her an appreciation for the 
norms, traditions, and responsibilities and prepare her well in 
leading the Office.&#x27;&#x27; They add, quote, ``We are confident that 
she has what it takes to serve as Solicitor General.&#x27;&#x27; The 
Committee has also received letters of support from a 
bipartisan group of Supreme Court practitioners, many of whom 
served in the Republican administration. They write, and I 
quote in part, ``The Solicitor General role is challenging, 
demands intellectual honesty, consistent open-mindedness, and 
willingness to listen. Throughout her career, Elizabeth 
Prelogar has demonstrated these qualities. She treasures legal 
rigor, respects all persons, is fully committed to serving the 
public interests.&#x27;&#x27; High praise from leading practitioners, but 
in particular a group that includes Republican former officials 
like Don Ayer, John Bash, John Elwood, and Peter Keisler.
    Without objection, I&#x27;ll enter both of the letters into the 
record and look forward to hearing from all our nominees 
shortly after turning first to my friend and colleague, Ranking 
Member Chuck Grassley.
    [The information appears as a submission for the record.]

         OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CHARLES E. GRASSLEY,

             A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF IOWA

    Senator Grassley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before I give my 
remarks, I want to recognize the leaving of the Committee staff 
of Mike Fragoso. He was chief counsel for nominations, and 
before that, he worked for Chairman Graham. Mike was an 
invaluable member of my team. He cares deeply about the rule of 
law. He understands the duties that we have here in the Senate, 
and he navigates the fine details of Senate procedure with 
ease. Mike left our Committee during the August recess, but 
this isn&#x27;t the end of Mike&#x27;s time with the Senate. He&#x27;s now 
going to be in Mitch McConnell&#x27;s office as chief counsel, and 
I&#x27;m sure that he&#x27;ll continue to benefit from his work--or we&#x27;re 
going to benefit from his work in that office.
    I also want to introduce my new chief counsel for 
nominations, Brendan Chestnut. Some of you may know him from 
previous service. He worked for some of our country&#x27;s leading 
law firms, he clerked on the Ninth Circuit, and he previously 
served as nomination counsel for the Judiciary Committee. We 
welcome Brendan back, and I&#x27;m glad to have you here.
    We have four nominees today: two circuit court, Solicitor 
General, and one Director of Office of National Drug Control 
Policy. Before speaking about the nominees, I want to address 
the protest by left-wing activists outside of Justice 
Kavanaugh&#x27;s home last night. A partisan group announced that 
Justice Kavanaugh was going to hear from us directly, quote, 
unquote, ``hear from us directly,&#x27;&#x27; because he has been, quote, 
unquote, ``protected from any backlash for his votes on the 
Supreme Court.&#x27;&#x27;
    This protest looks like another blatant attempt to 
intimidate the judiciary and anyone who disagrees with the 
radical agenda pushed by partisan advocates. After all, a 
leader from this group recently pleaded no contest to criminal 
trespass and was ordered by a court to stay away from Senator 
Hawley&#x27;s wife. Partisan shots aimed at the independence of our 
judiciary ought to be concerning to everybody.
    Dark money groups like Demand Justice run dishonest attacks 
to try to undermine the people&#x27;s trust in the Federal 
judiciary. These groups do it for partisan purposes. They want 
to bully judges into ruling in line with their liberal agenda 
no matter what the law says, and if that doesn&#x27;t work, they 
want to pack the court. I believe the American people reject 
the extreme agenda of these left-wing groups.
    Now, to today&#x27;s agenda. Justice Robinson is nominated for 
the Second Circuit. She currently serves on the Vermont Supreme 
Court. While in private practice, Justice Robinson did a fair 
bit of civil rights work. As I said before, so did Judge 
Michael Park and Judge Steven Menashi, who President Trump 
nominated to the same Second Circuit. Judge Park fought against 
racial discrimination in higher education, and Judge Menashi 
fought against religious discrimination in the Department of 
Education. I supported both of those nominees because I felt 
confident that their judicial philosophy meant that they would 
rule based on the law, not their personal views.
    This administration&#x27;s nominees have generally refused to 
answer questions about their judicial philosophy, at least when 
asked at a hearing. It&#x27;s hard to support a judicial nominee who 
won&#x27;t tell us their approach to deciding cases. It also is hard 
to support a nominee for a lifetime appointment if they haven&#x27;t 
thought enough about the job to have a judicial philosophy.
    Justice Robinson has served as a State court judge for 
several years, so I hope we can have a productive discussion 
about her judicial philosophy. I will also note that Justice 
Robinson&#x27;s support comes from Vermont and its legal community.
    Ms. Sung is the second nominee, and she is nominated for an 
Oregon seat on the Ninth Circuit. Judge Graber, who currently 
sits in that seat, is well respected. She has said that some of 
her favorite cases involve interp--involve interpreting 
statutes because it&#x27;s like a puzzle. She likes working out how 
different parts of the law fit together. Because of that, she 
takes an interest in many different areas of the law. I see Ms. 
Sung this way, focusing intensely on labor law, and working 
closely with labor leaders. That may be why Demand Justice and 
Chris Kang are excited about her nomination and why Ms. Sung&#x27;s 
strongest supporters seem to be in San Francisco and 
Washington, DC. She has also made a number of partisan 
statements about judicial nominees. Given those comments and 
her narrow focus on the law, I&#x27;m not sure she&#x27;s a good fit for 
the Ninth Circuit, which sees a broad array of cases.
    On the second panel, we have the administration&#x27;s nominee 
to serve as Solicitor General, Ms. Prelogar. She has an 
exemplary resume. She clerked for two Supreme Court Justices. 
She serves as Acting Solicitor General for several months 
before her nomination. She may carry out this administration&#x27;s 
priorities very well, but I&#x27;m concerned about recent choices 
made at the Department of Justice. I hope she will show a 
willingness to be a voice of reason there and push back on 
partisan decisions that have seen--I&#x27;ve seen recently in this 
administration.
    Finally, Dr. Gupta has been nominated to serve as Director 
of Office of National Drug Control Policy. He has served in 
public health roles in State and local governments and has an 
extensive experience dealing with opioid crisis. I hope today&#x27;s 
hearing shows that he is a good fit for that role. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Senator Grassley. Let me respond very 
briefly to your comments about the demonstrations before a 
Supreme Court Justice&#x27;s home last evening. Politics ain&#x27;t 
beanbag. We all know that you have to have a tough mental hide 
to be in this business. But it is absolutely unacceptable, from 
my point of view, to involve any major public figure&#x27;s family 
or their home, or to involve yourself in criminal trespass in 
the name of political freedom of speech. I think most of my 
colleagues share this feeling. We&#x27;re the ones with our names on 
the ballot. We&#x27;re the ones who are elected. There are proper 
venues to express yourself, and I don&#x27;t believe a person&#x27;s 
home, or their family should be fair game in this business. I 
concur with your thinking on that. When it comes to criminal 
trespass, we got a belly full of that on January 6th. I don&#x27;t 
care whether you&#x27;re right or left; that is unacceptable as far 
as I&#x27;m concerned in expressing your political feelings.
    We have a number of colleagues who are here to speak on 
behalf of the nominees before the Committee this morning, and 
we&#x27;ll start with Senator Leahy.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PATRICK J. LEAHY,

            A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VERMONT

    Senator Leahy. Thank you Senator Durbin. Incidentally, both 
as a Senator and as a former prosecutor, I totally agree with 
what you just said. That--you know, you can state your opinion 
of any one of us at the ballot box. You can write letters. 
Trying to intimidate family, anything like that, is wrong.
    On a happier note, I couldn&#x27;t be more proud to introduce 
Vermont&#x27;s very own Justice Beth Robinson at her confirmation 
hearing this morning to serve as a judge on the Second Circuit 
Court of Appeals. Senator Sanders and I both know that Vermont 
traditionally has one seat on that circuit, and so we try to 
have the absolute best, and we&#x27;ve done that here. I know her 
mother, Cynthia, her sister Barbara, her wife Kym, all are here 
in the audience today, and I was talking with them earlier. We 
all share that same sense of great pride.
    I can say with confidence that Vermonters, regardless of 
party or ideology, are delighted that President Biden nominated 
Beth Robinson to fill the Vermont seat on the Second Circuit.
    Last month, as I went around the State of Vermont, I had so 
many people, Republicans and Democrats, come up and say, ``This 
is a great choice.&#x27;&#x27; She&#x27;s been hailed as a tireless champion 
for equal rights and equal justice in the mold of the late 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. It&#x27;s no exaggeration to say that 
Beth helped Vermont and America more fully realize the meaning 
of equality under the law.
    Thousands upon thousands of LGBTQ individuals across the 
country are able to live their lives with dignity, thanks in 
part to the pioneering advocacy of Beth Robinson, and her 
nomination is truly historic. These are not the primary reasons 
that Beth Robinson is sitting before us today. Instead, it is 
Beth&#x27;s track record as a Vermont Supreme Court Justice, her 
fairness, impartiality, and loyalty to the rule of law that 
make her the best possible nominee for the Second Circuit 
position.
    All current Vermont Supreme Court Justices, appointed by 
both Republican and Democratic Governors, have signed a letter 
supporting Beth&#x27;s nomination, praising her as an excellent 
jurist who is measured. The Chief Justice of our court, 
appointed by a Republican, went out of his way to tell me that 
personally.
    Three former Vermont Supreme Court Justices, again 
appointed by both Republicans and Democrats, have written 
letters of support for her. Vermont&#x27;s Republican Governor Phil 
Scott has penned a letter urging her confirmation, and he noted 
that she was unanimously confirmed in a bipartisan show of 
support by the Vermont Senate. Every Republican, every Democrat 
voted for her because she is widely respected for her character 
and integrity. Mr. Chairman, I ask that those letters be 
included in the record.
    [The information appears as a submission for the record.]
    Chair Durbin. Without objection.
    Senator Leahy. Then the list of support letters from 
leaders across the political spectrum go on. Testament to her 
unimpeachable decade-long track record as a jurist dedicated to 
her craft, loyal to the law above all else, and it&#x27;s these 
qualities--compassion for all parties appearing before her, 
collegiality with those who disagree with her, and her 
brilliant legal mind--that make Beth Robinson the right person 
for the job.
    I urge all Senators to evaluate Justice Robinson&#x27;s record. 
It&#x27;s our solemn obligation as Senators to provide advice and 
consent to the President&#x27;s nominee, and I think the Senators of 
both parties will see, as I have that Justice Robinson 
possesses exactly the right qualities, skills, and experience 
to excel as a judge in the Second Circuit. I congratulate 
Justice Robinson. Delighted to see her family here, this 
historic nomination, and I look forward to seeing her 
expeditiously confirmed to the Second Circuit. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Leahy. Senator Sanders, 
from Vermont.

               STATEMENT OF HON. BERNIE SANDERS,

            A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VERMONT

    Senator Sanders. Thank you, Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member 
Grassley, and Senator Leahy. Today it is my privilege to 
introduce Vermont Supreme Court Justice Beth Robinson, who has 
been nominated to serve as a judge on the Second Circuit Court 
of Appeals. Justice Robinson is undeniably one of the most 
notable champions of equal rights and equal justice and, in 
particular, she is one of our Nation&#x27;s most important pioneers 
in advancing LGBTQ rights.
    In the landmark case of Baker v. Vermont, then Attorney 
General Robinson secured a ruling in favor of marriage equality 
in 2009. This was one of our country&#x27;s first major advances in 
LGBTQ rights. It was a major step forward towards--it was a 
major step towards our laws acknowledging that people have the 
right to love whomever they want and to get married, regardless 
of their sexual orientation. As a direct result of this 
victory, Vermont&#x27;s legislature enacted the first civil union 
law in the country. Vermont has led the country on this issue, 
and that is due in no small part to Justice Robinson&#x27;s 
dedication and hard work.
    Justice Robinson is extremely well qualified for this 
position on the Federal court. She has served on Vermont&#x27;s 
Supreme Court since 2011 and has built a reputation for her 
impartiality and fair application of the law. She treats people 
with respect and compassion, and she understands the duty of 
the court to provide equitable justice. I believe she will make 
Vermont proud and that she will be an excellent addition to the 
Federal bench.
    Congratulations, Justice Robinson, on your nomination. 
Thank you for your continued service to our country and for 
your commitment to equality and justice. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Senator Sanders. The Committee and 
those in attendance all understand that you have a busy 
schedule and that if you have to depart any time soon, it&#x27;s 
understandable.
    We&#x27;re honored to have Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon here 
next.

                  STATEMENT OF HON. RON WYDEN,

            A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF OREGON

    Senator Wyden. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I&#x27;m 
pleased to be able to introduce Jennifer Sung, my neighbor who 
lives around the corner from me in Southeast Portland, who&#x27;s 
President Biden&#x27;s nominee to serve on the US Court of Appeals 
for the Ninth Circuit. And I listened to our colleague, my 
friend, Senator Grassley say that Ms. Sung&#x27;s supporters were 
located in various parts of the country. Her strongest 
supporters, Senator Grassley, are 100 percent of Oregon&#x27;s 
United States Senators, who live in her neighborhood in 
Southeast Portland.
    I got to know Ms. Sung through a variety of conversations--
I&#x27;m going to keep this brief, and I was struck that the story 
of the Sung family is much like the story of the Wyden family. 
The Sungs fled violence and political persecution in China in 
the 1940&#x27;s. My dad fled the Nazis in the 1930&#x27;s, got into the 
United States Army, and was involved in dropping propaganda 
pamphlets on the Nazis. Both of our families were ecstatic to 
come to the freest and most open country on Earth, where we 
were able to find safety and opportunity. In both families, the 
Sungs and the Wydens, we were taught to give back to America. 
Ms. Sung did that, helping low-income patients who needed 
assistance with their healthcare. The Wydens, as you know, 
pitched in with senior citizens.
    I will also say, when you look fast-forward at her 
qualifications serving as a second term as a member of Oregon&#x27;s 
employee--Employment Relations Board, which adjudicates 
disputes over labor practices and employment law in my home 
State, she has brought stellar impartiality to the effort. She 
decided more than 200 cases and her impartiality and commitment 
to justice, and I say this particularly because I heard 
comments about my good friend Judge Graber, she follows in that 
Graber mold of academic excellence and impartiality.
    Finally, Ms. Sung&#x27;s qualifications and her experience 
really stand, as I stated, on their own. Her nomination and her 
eventual confirmation is also going to help make the courts 
look a little more like America, a little more representative 
of what our great Nation is all about. I offer a full and 
unqualified endorsement of my neighbor, Ms. Jennifer Sung to be 
President Biden&#x27;s nominee to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the Ninth Circuit.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Senator Wyden. From the same 
neighborhood, Senator Merkley.

                STATEMENT OF HON. JEFF MERKLEY,

            A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF OREGON

    Senator Merkley. Thank you so much, Chairman Durbin, and 
Ranking Member Grassley, and men and women of the Judiciary 
Committee for the opportunity to echo the sentiments of Senior 
Senator from Oregon, who has stated it so well, that Ms. 
Jennifer Sung is an exceptional Oregonian, nominated to fill a 
vacancy on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
    As we have seen time and time again, it&#x27;s absolutely 
critical that we have nominees to the Federal bench with the 
experience and expertise necessary to serve the American people 
and the rule of law. It&#x27;s essential that they will protect our 
Nation&#x27;s values of freedom and equality for all, and will 
ensure equal justice for all, stressing the word equal, working 
with legislators to make sure there are as many protections for 
the rights of ordinary citizens as for the powerful and the 
privileged. That is so often not the case, and we need 
champions to make it be the case.
    Ms. Sung has shown throughout her remarkable career that 
it&#x27;s precisely those attributes that she will bring to the 
Ninth Circuit. From her days as a union organizer, working to 
help ensure a voice for working Americans, to her time as a 
litigator, specializing in labor, employment, and 
constitutional law, right up to her time as a member of our 
State&#x27;s Employment Relations Board, where she helped to decide 
over 200 cases, Ms. Sung has been a steadfast champion for 
American workers and a committed servant to the public 
interest.
    When confirmed, she will bring with her a breadth and depth 
of knowledge critically needed on the Federal bench. She will 
add much needed diversity, not only in heritage and culture, 
but in real-world experiences, to a bench that does not come 
close enough today to representing the broad range of 
experiences, cultures, and heritages that make up our richly 
diverse Nation. Most critically, Ms. Sung will bring with her a 
passionate and dedicated commitment to ensuring equal justice 
for all Americans, so I am proud to join Senator Wyden in 
giving her my full support.
    Thank you for the time considering her nomination. I hope 
that after this hearing today you will be as impressed as 
Senator Wyden and I have been and will recommend Jennifer 
Sung&#x27;s confirmation to the Ninth Circuit and encourage 
expeditious consideration by the full Senate. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks Senator Merkley. Next, we have the 
West Virginia Senators here. The entire delegation has arrived, 
and they&#x27;re here to introduce Dr. Gupta. Senator Manchin, we&#x27;ll 
start with you.

              STATEMENT OF HON. JOE MANCHIN, III,

         A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA

    Senator Manchin. Thank you, Senator Durbin, and Senator 
Grassley, and all my colleagues and friends that sit on this 
prestigious Committee. We are all going to stay in the same 
neighborhood, so we&#x27;re in good shape here.
    It&#x27;s an honor introducing my fellow West Virginian to the 
Judiciary Committee today, Dr. Rahul Gupta, nominee for the 
Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. First, 
you need to know about this person.
    Before I start with his incredible career, I want to note 
the wonderful people who support Dr. Gupta that are here today. 
His wife, Dr. Seema Gupta. Dr. Seema Gupta, who currently 
serves as a physician at the VA, Dr. Seema. Then he has twin 
boys, Arka and Drew, and I&#x27;ve known these boys since they were 
babies and watched them grow. Here&#x27;s the accomplishment. They 
both completed undergraduate degrees at Yale, they both are at 
Harvard now, one in law and one in medicine. I think that says 
everything you need to know about Dr. Gupta, first of all, to 
have such an accomplished family, and as a father and a 
husband.
    Dr. Gupta serves--currently serves as the chief medical and 
health officer and senior vice president at the March of Dimes, 
and interim chief science officer overseeing the research and 
global health portfolio, a clinical professor in the Department 
of Medicine at Georgetown University School of Medicine. He&#x27;s 
also an adjunct professor in the Department of Health Policy 
Management Leadership in the School of Public Health at West 
Virginia University and visiting faculty at Harvard T.H. Chan 
School of Public Health.
    I&#x27;m proud that yet another West Virginian has been 
nominated to serve the American people, and I have no doubt 
that Dr. Gupta will be a dedicated Director of the ONDCP. As a 
longtime resident of our home State of West Virginia, Dr. Gupta 
served as the health commissioner of West Virginia under both a 
Democrat and Republican Governor and led the State&#x27;s response 
to this horrible drug epidemic that we have in our State and 
all across our country. Dr. Gupta, as you can tell, has also 
received bipartisan support from myself and my friend and my 
colleague Senator Capito. Also from Republican Governor 
Justice. Both have touted, and we all have touted his valuable 
contributions to battling the drug epidemic in our home State.
    I myself, when I was Governor, had the honor of working 
with Dr. Gupta, and he served as the director of the Kanawha 
County Health Department. Many times during this horrible 
ravage of opiate overdose in the epidemic we have going on in 
this State, he would talk and converse with me, and we would 
talk together about how we would approach this problem, how we 
could overcome this problem, and he did so many things and been 
such a valued friendship to help me through the most difficult 
times of fighting this horrible scourge on our State.
    As a primary care physician, Dr. Gupta intimately 
understands the needs of communities across America, and he&#x27;d 
be the first physician, as you noted out, Dr. Durbin--Dr. 
Durbin?
    [Laughter.]
    Why not? We&#x27;re in the neighborhood. Senator Durbin, as you 
noted, that he would be the first to hold this position as a 
physician. As a commissioner of the West Virginia Bureau of 
Public Health, Dr. Gupta saw firsthand the devastation that the 
opioid epidemic has unleashed on the communities and led 
statewide efforts to tackle the drug epidemic. His work leading 
efforts to combat drug epidemic in a State with one of the 
worst overdose states--rates in the Nation, where we lost 1,377 
West Virginians to fatal drug-related overdoses just last year, 
one year, makes him well-prepared to lead similar efforts on a 
national scale.
    I don&#x27;t think a better person who has had upfront on the 
line, on the front line of fighting this epidemic would ever be 
better prepared than Dr. Gupta. We have lost 93,331 Americans 
in the last year alone. In 2017, he was even named West 
Virginian of the Year as a result of these efforts that he&#x27;s 
been fighting. He&#x27;s a dedicated public servant. He has served 
West Virginians admirably throughout his time as a health 
commissioner.
    I&#x27;m proud to introduce him along with my colleague, Senator 
Capito. I strongly support his nomination to be Director of 
ONDCP and urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support Dr. Gupta&#x27;s nomination and look forward to working with 
him. I look forward for you all to get to know him better 
because I guarantee, it&#x27;ll be a pleasure. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Senator Manchin. Thanks for 
conferring a degree on me at this hearing----
    Senator Manchin. As if you needed another, sir.
    Chair Durbin [continuing]. I definitely do not deserve. I&#x27;m 
reminded of an old friend of mine who used to say I just missed 
the dean&#x27;s list by two grades, A and B.
    [Laughter.]
    Chair Durbin. Thank you for your testimony. Senator Capito.

            STATEMENT OF HON. SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO,

         A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA

    Senator Capito. Thank you, Chairman Durbin. Thank you, 
Ranking Member Grassley for having us here today to talk about 
a good friend to both of us.
    Dr. Gupta, you cannot have a better nominee for the 
Director of ONDCP, I don&#x27;t believe. As Senator Manchin 
mentioned, he&#x27;s joined by his wife Seema, who was a physician 
at our CBOC, Veterans&#x27; CBOC, in Charleston, and when I visited 
there, they were sorry when the Guptas decided to come to 
Washington to lose her. Then, of course, their twin sons, Arka 
and Drew, who obviously are exceptional, but they were 
wonderful top graduates of the high school where is in my 
district, George Washington High School, so the Patriots are 
very proud of those boys.
    I first met Dr. Gupta in 2009, when he moved to my hometown 
of Charleston, West Virginia to become the Director and Health 
Officer at the Kanawha County Charleston Health Department. I 
learned some things in researching to see what I would say 
today that I didn&#x27;t know about Dr. Gupta.
    He was actually born in India and raised in Maryland in the 
suburbs of Washington, DC. By the time we met, I met him, he 
already had an impressive resume of academic and medical 
accomplishments. At age 21, he completed medical school at the 
University of Delhi, and subsequently did his internship and 
residency at St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital Northwestern University in 
Chicago, Illinois. He earned a master&#x27;s degree in public health 
from the University of Alabama, Birmingham, and a global 
master&#x27;s of business degree from the London School of Business 
and Finance. He&#x27;s obviously a perpetual learner. Prior to his 
position in Charleston, he also was on academic faculty in 
Tennessee and Alabama.
    In 2014, Dr. Gupta and I were boarding a plane to fly home 
to Charleston, West Virginia. We did not realize at the time we 
had heard a story about a chemical leak into the water supply 
system of our hometown of Charleston, West Virginia. While we 
weren&#x27;t sure of the aspects of it, I remember he and I talking 
as we were getting on, at then, a prop plane to fly home, and 
Dr. Gupta really led--led the public health response to this 
chemical spill, which really led us to not be able to drink our 
water for six to eight weeks, with a mysterious chemical that 
we weren&#x27;t really sure what it was. I&#x27;m forever grateful for 
his leadership, not just working with West Virginians, but also 
with the CDC to help us realize the best kind of response in--
in a water crisis situation.
    He was then appointed, as Senator Manchin said, to the 
Bureau of Public Health. He has served two Governors, as 
Senator Manchin--I keep wanting to call you Joe. As Joe said.
    Senator Manchin. We&#x27;re still Joe and Shelley.
    Senator Capito. You&#x27;re still Joe and Shelley, yes.
    Anyway, throughout his career, he&#x27;s done so much, but I 
think nothing more than what he&#x27;s done in the area that would 
be covered under the National Drug Control Policy. He 
understands the crippling effect of addiction. Our State has 
been hard hit, especially hard hit, and he is uniquely, I 
think, situated to use this knowledge to serve our Nation. I 
congratulate President Biden on this nomination. It&#x27;s just 
exceptional.
    As Senator Manchin mentioned, our Governor is very much in 
support. He has said that Dr. Gupta led the way in our battle 
against the opioid crisis, something that has and continues to 
touch the lives of nearly one of our residents in some way. 
Under his leadership, our State turned a corner, and there&#x27;s so 
much more to be done.
    The head of our local Kanawha Charleston Board of Health, 
Jeremy Nelson, also said, ``We believe Dr. Gupta&#x27;s record of 
excellence in public service at both local and State levels 
makes him well suited to serve as the State&#x27;s--as the Nation&#x27;s 
next drug czar.&#x27;&#x27; Also, from even our national--there&#x27;s a lot 
of support from our national folks, and I will echo those 
sentiments as well.
    We got a lot of visits from Jim Carroll and Michael 
Botticelli, who were the former drug czars at ONDCP. We know 
Dr. Gupta will visit West Virginia frequently, and we need the 
attention not only because we have a lot of the solutions in 
West Virginia that, I think, can serve and help the Nation 
tackle this difficult problem.
    I am confident that President Biden has submitted a nominee 
who will continue to do the good work of his predecessors. I 
know he will visit West Virginia. Please note, he has on a 
golden blue tie in honor of our State. He brings a wealth of 
real-world experience necessary to confront the realities of 
today&#x27;s addiction crisis and to resume the progress our Nation 
was beginning to see pre-pandemic.
    I join with Senator Manchin today. It&#x27;s no accident that 
we&#x27;re both here. I think that it&#x27;s a tribute not only to Dr. 
Gupta, but it&#x27;s also a tribute to Dr. Gupta&#x27;s dedication to 
see--make sure that every public servant in our State was aware 
of what he was doing, the challenges he was facing, and how we 
can help. Congratulations to Dr. Gupta again. I thank President 
Biden for this excellent nomination.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Senator Capito and Senator Manchin. I 
appreciate your attendance this morning. We&#x27;re going to change 
the nameplates, and we&#x27;re going to invite Justice Robinson and 
Ms. Sung to come forward to be sworn as soon as we get the 
housekeeping out of the way.
    If you&#x27;ll please raise your right hand.
    [Witnesses are sworn in.]
    Let the record reflect that both witnesses answered in the 
affirmative. Justice Robinson, please proceed with your opening 
remarks. You have to push the button to light up the light.

              STATEMENT OF BETH ROBINSON, NOMINEE

                  TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT

                  JUDGE FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

    Ms. Robinson. That&#x27;s not indicative of my ability to follow 
the law and directions in a general sense. Thank you, Chair 
Durbin and Ranking Member Grassley. I appreciate the 
opportunity to appear in your Committee. I want to acknowledge 
my deep gratitude to President Biden for the confidence he&#x27;s 
placed in me with this nomination. Senator Leahy and Senator 
Sanders, I&#x27;m deeply moved and honored by your exceptionally 
generous introductions. Thank you for your support.
    I&#x27;ve been blessed with a large and wonderful family, 
including my parents, four older siblings, siblings and 
parents-in-law, 15 beloved nieces and nephews, aunts, uncles, 
and twenty-one cousins and their own spouses, kids, and 
grandkids, all of whom are part of my circle in life.
    My sprawling clan is well represented by the three behind 
me. My parents, Bob and Cindy, recently celebrated their 69th 
wedding anniversary. They&#x27;ve given me unwavering support 
throughout my life and have always taught me that the measure 
of success is what you give to the world, not the other way 
around. My father couldn&#x27;t be here, but I&#x27;m grateful that my 
mother made the trip from Indiana to join me today. I&#x27;m 
likewise grateful that my sister Barbara has made the trip from 
Minnesota to stand in for all the folks who would love to be 
here. I&#x27;m joined by my life partner of nearly 29 years, my wife 
Kym. Without her decades of support, I most assuredly would not 
be here today.
    For the past decade as a Justice on the Vermont Supreme 
Court, I have done my best to interpret and apply the law 
evenhandedly, consistent with precedent, statutes, and the 
Constitution that binds me. I would be honored to continue my 
work promoting the rule of law as a judge on the Second 
Circuit.
    Senators, I&#x27;m well aware of the awesome responsibilities 
that the Members of this Committee juggle every day, and I 
truly appreciate all of your service. I look forward to 
answering your questions. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you very much. Ms. Sung, please 
proceed.

              STATEMENT OF JENNIFER SUNG, NOMINEE

               TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE

                     FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

    Ms. Sung. Thank you, Chair Durbin, Ranking Member Grassley, 
and all of the Committee Members for this opportunity to appear 
here today. Thank you to Senators Wyden and Merkley for your 
support, and the very kind introductions. Thank you, President 
Biden for the tremendous honor of this nomination. I am humbled 
to be nominated to fill the seat of Hon. Susan Graber, who has 
served the Ninth Circuit with the utmost integrity and 
distinction since 1998.
    Here with me today are my wonderful husband, Ryan Mehan, 
and our daughter Maeve, our bringer of great joy. I cannot 
thank them enough. Also with me is my brother, Jeffrey Sung, a 
proud Army veteran. I thank him for his service and his support 
throughout this process. I would also like to thank all the 
family, friends, and colleagues who could not be here, 
including my stepson Meiko; my sister-in-law, Sue; my nephews 
and niece, Lincoln, Declan, and Malia; my mother-in-law, Janet 
Mehan; and my father-in-law, Ken Mehan, who we sadly lost last 
year. To my parents, Steven and Cheryl Sung, I owe a special 
debt of gratitude and love for all that they have given so that 
Jeff and I could pursue our American Dreams. And finally, I pay 
respect to all of my grandparents, each of whom faced great 
challenges with great courage and integrity.
    My family instilled in me a deep appreciation of how 
fortunate I am to be an American--to grow up in a country where 
our fundamental rights, like the freedom of religion and 
speech, are guaranteed in our constitution and enforced in our 
courts. For this reason, it would be the highest honor of my 
professional life to serve my country as a judge and share the 
awesome responsibility for upholding the Constitution that we 
all cherish. Thank you for considering my nomination.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you very much Ms. Sung. Let me start 
the questioning. You&#x27;ve been an appointed member of the Oregon 
Employment Relations Board since 2017, and as it&#x27;s commonly 
known, the ERB is a three-member panel representing diverse 
perspectives on labor and employment issues.
    Of the approximately 200 matters you&#x27;ve presided over, 
you&#x27;ve ruled in favor in some instances for employers, in other 
instances for employees. As a member of that board, you analyze 
the record and caselaw and try to be a neutral adjudicator, I&#x27;m 
sure. You also work with your fellow board members to try to 
find consensus where possible and to collaborate on draft 
language. What have you learned from that experience that you 
think will help you as judge in the Ninth Circuit?
    Ms. Sung. Thank you for the question, Chair Durbin. As you 
noted, I&#x27;ve served as a neutral adjudicator for nearly five 
years, and I serve on a three-member panel issuing decisions, 
and that is--that panel is professionally diverse by design. I 
think that experience has especially deepened my appreciation 
for collegiality. I work hard to reach consensus whenever 
possible, and the vast majority of our decisions are unanimous. 
I believe that experience will serve me well as an appellate 
judge, should I be confirmed.
    Chair Durbin. Ms. Sung, in July 2018, as a Yale Law School 
alum, you signed onto a letter to Yale Law School leadership 
expressing concern about then Judge Kavanaugh&#x27;s nomination to 
the Supreme Court. Would you like to comment on that letter in 
light of your nomination?
    Ms. Sung. Yes, thank you again, Chair Durbin. The letter 
that you referenced was addressed only to my law school 
administration, and I signed it strictly in my personal 
capacity as a private citizen addressing my alma mater. I did 
not write the letter, but I recognize that much of its rhetoric 
was overheated, and if by signing that letter, I created the 
impression that I would prejudge any case or fail to respect 
the authority of any Supreme Court Justice, or any of the 
Court&#x27;s precedents, then I sincerely apologize.
    Throughout my legal career as a litigator and as an 
adjudicator, I have respected the authority of every Supreme 
Court Justice, and I have followed all of the Court&#x27;s 
precedents without reservation, and I would continue to do so 
as a lower court judge if confirmed.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you. Justice Robinson, you&#x27;ve been on 
the Vermont Supreme Court for 10 years; before that, in your 
private practice, you were a policy advocate. Obviously, we&#x27;d 
like to hear your comments about how those policy positions and 
your advocacy might impact your impartiality as a judge.
    Ms. Robinson. Thank you, Senator Durbin. Appreciate the 
question. Ten years ago, I did make the transition from 
advocate to judge, and it was a major transition in at least 
two ways. As an advocate, my focus was the interests of my 
individual clients, and that was my duty and commitment.
    As a judge, my duty and commitment is to the law without 
regard to the interests of any particular clients or even my 
own personal predilections. The other difference is that as an 
advocate for policy matters, I was very much a political person 
at that phase in my life. Upon assuming the bench, that aspect 
of my life ended because there&#x27;s no space for a politically 
oriented person on the bench.
    For the last decade, that prior part of my life, of which 
I&#x27;m very proud, but it ceased to guide my work upholding the 
rule of law. The thing that made that transition easy for me is 
that I feel the same passion and commitment to my mission in 
this position, which is to uphold the rule of law, as I felt 
for any cause I advocated in the last chapter of my career.
    Chair Durbin. I take it from the kind words and support you 
received from so many of diverse backgrounds in Vermont that 
you&#x27;ve been able to stick with that basic principle for 10 
years on the supreme court of that State. I acknowledge that 
you have 10 years of proof that you can divorce a former life 
of policy advocacy to a new responsibility. I thank you for 
your being here today. Senator Grassley?
    Senator Grassley. Ms. Sung, I was going to ask the same 
question that Senator Durbin did about the letter you signed. 
I&#x27;m not going to ask you to speak more about it, but I just 
want you to know why I was concerned about that because I think 
it doesn&#x27;t show the temperament that we should expect from 
judicial nominees. You don&#x27;t have to comment any further. I&#x27;m 
going to go to my next question. Your career has primarily 
involved civil litigation and labor law. Do you have any 
experience in criminal law?
    Ms. Sung. Thank you, Ranking Member Grassley. As a Ninth 
Circuit judicial law clerk, I dealt with nearly the full range 
of issues that are presented to the circuit, including criminal 
and habeas matters. I am confident, based on that experience as 
well--as well as other experience I have had as a litigator and 
as a neutral adjudicator--that I can quickly get up to speed to 
any criminal matters or other matters that may be presented to 
me if I am confirmed.
    Senator Grassley. You may give the same answer, but I&#x27;m 
going to ask this question in regard to immigration because 
Ninth Circuit has so many immigration--heavy load of 
immigration cases. Please tell me your experience in handling 
immigration cases, specifically how many cases have you 
personally been involved in involving immigration matters?
    Ms. Sung. Thank you again, Ranking Member Grassley. As you 
anticipated, I did have a great deal of experience dealing with 
immigration cases as a Ninth Circuit judicial law clerk, and as 
well as in employment law there is some intersection with 
immigration law.
    Senator Grassley. Okay. I&#x27;m going to go to Ms. Robinson. 
I&#x27;m going to give you a question, and then I&#x27;m going to quote 
from something you said or wrote, and then I&#x27;m going to ask the 
question again, just so you can be ready.
    What is the role of a Federal court in making law and 
catalyzing social change? On a panel before the Vermont 
judicial system, you suggested that the judiciary has a role to 
play in making laws. You said that, quote, ``Don&#x27;t enact laws 
is not quite the same as don&#x27;t make laws.&#x27;&#x27; On an ABA panel, 
you once said, quote, ``Court decisions don&#x27;t simply provide 
the remedy ordered in a particular case; they can catalyze 
broad social and legal change.&#x27;&#x27; Then the question again. What 
is the role of a Federal court in making law and catalyzing 
social change?
    Justice Robinson. Thank you, Senator. The role of the 
Federal court is to interpret the law and apply it to the facts 
in the record in the case before it and in an individual case. 
I&#x27;m not familiar with the specific--I am familiar, but I don&#x27;t 
remember the context of the exact quotes you read. I have, in 
public speaking about the role of courts, tried to educate 
folks about the fact that in State courts, we have common law, 
which is judge made law, and it&#x27;s something that people whose 
only education about the court system comes from the Federal 
hearings don&#x27;t realize. I don&#x27;t know if that was the context, 
but it may have been.
    Senator Grassley. The Second Circuit--also, for you, the 
Second Circuit is known for having significant numbers of 
security class actions, antitrust cases, and other complex 
commercial cases. Can you tell us about your experiences 
handling these types of cases?
    Justice Robinson. I can tell you, Senator, that one of the 
things I&#x27;ve learned about myself during my 10 years on the 
Vermont Supreme Court, is that I love learning new things, and 
I actually enjoy complexity. I enjoy trying to figure out 
complex questions of law, maybe if the brief is--makes it more 
confusing, those are the kinds of challenges that I enjoy. I 
think that that will serve me well on the Second Circuit.
    Senator Grassley. Back to Ms. Sung. This will be my last 
question. How many cases have you personally argued before the 
Ninth Circuit, and how many briefs have you filed with the 
Ninth Circuit?
    Ms. Sung. Thank you for the question, Senator. In my career 
as a litigator, I argued and filed briefs in one case before 
the Ninth Circuit.
    Senator Grassley. Okay, thank you. I yield back my time.
    Chair Durbin. I just ask our witnesses to get as close to 
the microphone as you can, so you can be heard by everyone. I 
turn the floor over to Senator Leahy.
    Senator Leahy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know I love 
this Committee, having served on it for some time. I enjoy 
the--hearing the various nominees and--Justice Robinson, 
obviously I have a personal connection as a Vermonter to your 
nomination, but I have a hard time remembering people came to 
this confirmation hearing with such a truly impressive set of 
supporters from across the political spectrum. Vermont&#x27;s 
Republican Governor, multiple sitting and former Vermont 
Supreme Court Justices appointed by both Republicans and 
Democrats, former Republican legislators in the State, others.
    The letters I&#x27;ve had have been so impressive that have come 
in supporting you because I know these people, and I know they 
go across the political spectrum in our State. How have you 
managed to garner this much support from leaders and colleagues 
especially reflecting such a diverse ideological spectrum? 
What&#x27;s your secret because I&#x27;d like to try it?
    Justice Robinson. You&#x27;re kind, Senator Leahy, and I 
appreciate the question. I treasure the sense of collegiality 
in the Vermont community among leaders across the political 
spectrum, and I have felt privileged to be a part of those 
conversations. The law is complicated. Policy is complicated. 
There are a lot of hard questions out there, and I believe that 
we accomplish our best results when we come together across the 
spectrum and truly engage with one another. I hope that that&#x27;s 
been the experiences of folks that I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to 
work with in Vermont.
    Senator Leahy. Thank you. Like so many of the men and women 
who have been nomination to our various courts of appeals, 
you&#x27;ve had a long and proud record of advocacy on behalf of 
certain causes. Would that change your ability to serve as an 
impartial judge in the Second Circuit, or do you feel you can 
be an impartial judge on the Second Circuit?
    Justice Robinson. Thank you, Senator Leahy. I hope that a 
fair read of my record for the last decade as I served on the 
Vermont Supreme Court reflects my commitment to judging fairly 
and impartially and my departure from my prior phase of my 
career as an advocate. I would expect to bring the same sense 
of commitment to the rule of law if I were to be confirmed to 
serve on the Second Circuit.
    Senator Leahy. Could you just kind of elaborate on that 
because you have had 10 years as a supreme court Justice? 
You&#x27;ve had to hear cases of multitude of things. You&#x27;ve had to 
serve with other colleagues that come from a variety of 
political and academic backgrounds. What kind of lessons did 
you learn that would teach you to be impartial?
    Justice Robinson. I think we have to recognize that all of 
us bring ourselves to the business of judging and the 
responsibility of judging. We bring our background, our 
experience, and our attitudes. Our challenge and our 
responsibility as judges is to transcend that and interpret and 
apply the law in a way that is reflective of the law&#x27;s 
commands.
    One of the many checks and balances built into the legal 
system to help us overcome our individual perspectives is the 
give and take amongst judges on an appellate court. I&#x27;ve always 
treasured that. I have tremendous respect for my colleagues 
past and present on the Vermont Supreme Court. I have no doubt 
that I&#x27;ve been a better judge because of what they&#x27;ve taught me 
in difficult cases that we&#x27;ve confronted together.
    Senator Leahy. You&#x27;ve also served as chair of the Vermont 
Access to Justice Coalition. That&#x27;s a partnership between the 
Vermont Supreme Court and legal aid providers to bring 
meaningful access to Vermont&#x27;s justice system. You&#x27;ve 
participated in the Vermont Supreme Court&#x27;s ``On the Road&#x27;&#x27; 
series, which I wish they&#x27;d had when I was practicing law. 
You&#x27;ve held hearings in communities across Vermont to increase 
transparency. How are these kinds of things important to the 
way judges carry out their--carry out their duties? That&#x27;ll be 
my last question. I apologize to Ms. Sung, but I strongly 
support her nomination. Go ahead.
    Justice Robinson. Thank you, Senator. I think it&#x27;s 
important as judges that we find ways that are appropriate to 
engage in the broader community, the broader legal community 
and the broader community at large. Those are examples of ways 
in which our court as a whole, and myself and my individual 
committee work, have tried to be part of the Vermont legal 
community and make the kind of systemic change that we don&#x27;t we 
make in our adjudicative role when we decide individual cases.
    Senator Leahy. Thank you very much.
    Chair Durbin. The next Republican Senator by order of 
arrival is Senator Cotton.
    Senator Cotton. Thank you. Justice Robinson, I think I know 
the answer to this since you&#x27;ve been on the court for the last 
10 years, but I&#x27;d just like to ask you a couple of questions. 
Have you ever represented, before you were a judge, a terrorist 
at Guantanamo Bay?
    Justice Robinson. No.
    Senator Cotton. Have you represented any client in any 
matter related to terrorism?
    Justice Robinson. No.
    Senator Cotton. Ms. Sung, same two questions. Have you ever 
represented a terrorist at Guantanamo Bay?
    Ms. Sung. No, Senator.
    Senator Cotton. Have you ever represented any client in a 
matter related to terrorism?
    Ms. Sung. No, Senator.
    Senator Cotton. Thank you, both. Ms. Sung, you&#x27;re nominated 
to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Ninth Circuit has a 
bit of a checkered track record at the Supreme Court. The 
Supreme Court has taken more cases from the Ninth Circuit than 
any other case--or any other circuit, and its batting average 
over the last few years has not been great. Four out of five 
cases from the Ninth Circuit had been reversed in recent years 
by the Supreme Court. That&#x27;s gotten somewhat better after the 
judges nominated out there over the last administration, but 
still, it&#x27;s not great.
    If you are confirmed and the Supreme Court issues a ruling 
in any case, will you faithfully apply--apply that Supreme 
Court precedent?
    Ms. Sung. Without reservation, Senator.
    Senator Cotton. Thank you. I want to return to the letter 
that Senator Durbin referenced about the nomination of then 
Justice Kavanaugh. You signed that letter in the summer of 
2018. You said in your answer to Senator Durbin that you only 
signed it, you didn&#x27;t write it. You don&#x27;t draw a distinction, 
though between writing a letter and signing onto a letter 
written by someone else, do you? If you sign a letter, do you 
believe that you&#x27;re responsible for the contents of the letter?
    Ms. Sung. I certainly take responsibility for signing the 
letter, Senator.
    Senator Cotton. That would be the case, as well on a panel 
of judges in the Ninth Circuit. Even if you don&#x27;t write the 
opinion, if you sign onto it, you&#x27;re responsible for the 
reasoning in it.
    Ms. Sung. Yes, Senator.
    Senator Cotton. Okay. You also said that some of the 
rhetoric was overheated, with which I agree. Let&#x27;s just explore 
some of that rhetoric. You said that then Judge Kavanaugh was, 
quote, ``a threat to the most vulnerable,&#x27;&#x27; and you also 
thought that he was, quote, ``an intellectually and morally 
bankrupt ideologue,&#x27;&#x27; end quote. Could you explain why you 
thought Brett Kavanaugh was a morally bankrupt man?
    Ms. Sung. Thank you for the question, Senator. As I 
explained, I recognize that the statements were overheated 
rhetoric, but they were rhetorical advocacy. If, by signing the 
letter, I created the impression that I would fail to respect 
Justice Kavanaugh&#x27;s authority as a Supreme Court Justice or any 
of the Justices&#x27; authority or their precedents, then I do 
sincerely apologize. I can commit to you today that I would, if 
confirmed, as I have throughout my career, I would respect all 
of the Court&#x27;s precedents without reservation.
    Senator Cotton. When the authors of that letter, or whoever 
it was that contacted you to sign it, presented it to you, did 
you have even a moment&#x27;s thought to say, ``Whoa, let&#x27;s hold on? 
Like, we can say we disagree with Brett Kavanaugh--that&#x27;s fine, 
that&#x27;s within the bounds of civilized discourse--but to call 
him morally bankrupt, that really is inappropriate. We should 
take an editing pen to that.&#x27;&#x27;
    Ms. Sung. Appreciate the question, Senator. As I stated 
before, I simply signed the letter. I understood that the 
statements were rhetorical. When I signed it, I believed that 
the only intended audience was my law school administration and 
believed they would understand those statements to be 
rhetorical. As I said, I do apologize if by signing the letter 
I created the impression that I would be anything but impartial 
and fully respectful of the Court&#x27;s authority.
    Senator Cotton. Another statement in that letter was that, 
quote, ``People will die if he is confirmed,&#x27;&#x27; end quote. Has 
anyone died as a direct result to Brett Kavanaugh being 
confirmed to the Supreme Court?
    Ms. Sung. Thank you for the question, Senator. As I stated 
before, I understood those statements to be rhetorical advocacy 
only, and I do understand that I have to take responsibility 
for signing the letter, but I would like to assure you, the 
public, and every Supreme Court Justice that I do respect the 
authority of the Court, of every Justice duly confirmed sitting 
on the Court, and I would follow without reservation all of the 
Court&#x27;s precedents.
    Senator Cotton. You can&#x27;t point to someone who&#x27;s died over 
the last 3 years as a direct result of Brett Kavanaugh being 
confirmed as that letter predicted?
    Ms. Sung. No, sir.
    Senator Cotton. Okay. Just to be clear, so if the Supreme 
Court issues a ruling, whether that opinion is authored by 
Brett Kavanaugh, or Stephen Breyer, or Clarence Thomas, you 
will treat it with equal weight, and you will follow it if 
you&#x27;re confirmed to the Ninth Circuit?
    Ms. Sung. Absolutely, Senator.
    Senator Cotton. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Feinstein.
    Senator Feinstein. Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. Justice 
Robinson and Ms. Sung, I noted in reviewing your backgrounds 
that you both have significant experience in deciding legal 
disputes. Justice Robinson, you have served for more than a 
decade on the Vermont Supreme Court. Ms. Sung, you have also 
experience in deciding legal disputes through your service as a 
member of the Oregon Employment Relations Board.
    Here&#x27;s the question. I&#x27;d like each of you to please speak 
on what you have learned about deciding legal disputes as a 
result of your experiences. Please.
    Justice Robinson. Thank you, Senator Feinstein. One thing 
that I&#x27;ve learned is that when a case comes in, you might have 
a preliminary hypothesis about how it&#x27;s going to be resolved, 
but there&#x27;s no substitute for drilling down into the record 
deeply, reading all of the facts, researching the applicable 
law, and then conferring with your colleagues. As often as not, 
your initial impression may prove ill-founded. It&#x27;s one of the 
reasons why it&#x27;s important to approach every case with an open 
mind and do the work to ensure that your legal reasoning is 
sound.
    Senator Feinstein. Thank you.
    Ms. Sung. I&#x27;m not sure I can state it better than Justice 
Robinson.
    Senator Feinstein. Could you speak into the microphone?
    Ms. Sung. Sure. I said I&#x27;m not sure I could answer the 
question better than Justice Robinson, but certainly, my 
experience as a neutral adjudicator on the board has taught me 
the same lessons and the importance of approaching each case 
with an open mind, diligently reviewing the record, and 
reviewing the law, and collegially conferring with my board 
colleagues before reaching any final decision. I have benefited 
greatly from those conferences with my colleagues, and I would 
approach judging in the same way as an appellate judge if 
confirmed.
    Senator Feinstein. I&#x27;d like both of you to answer this 
quick question. You have both served as litigators and as such 
zealous advocates. How do you see that changing as a Federal 
judge? Judge Robinson.
    Justice Robinson. Senator Feinstein, thank you. I&#x27;ve had 
the experience for the past decade of playing a different role 
in the legal system, and one about which I am every bit as 
passionate as I ever was as an advocate. I think we need 
advocates in our system. We need good advocates, we need robust 
legal argument and research, but in the end, I feel that I&#x27;ve 
found my home in the judicial role, and I&#x27;m grateful to have 
had the opportunity to serve as I have.
    Senator Feinstein. Thank you. I addressed you as judge, and 
it should be Justice, so I want to apologize for that.
    Justice Robinson. Of course.
    Senator Feinstein. Please go ahead, Ms. Sung.
    Ms. Sung. Thank you, Senator. I left behind the role of an 
advocate five years ago, and as a neutral adjudicator, the role 
could not be more different. As an adjudicator, it is my duty 
to consider the arguments of all the parties, to neutrally and 
impartially apply the law to the facts as establishment--
established by the evidence and the record, and to go where the 
law and the facts lead me, and not--without favor to any party, 
and I will continue to do that if appt--confirmed.
    Senator Feinstein. Justice Robinson, I was impressed to see 
that during your decade of experience serving the Vermont 
Supreme Court, in one of the cases from earlier this year, you 
joined an opinion that upheld Vermont&#x27;s ban on large capacity 
gun magazines under the State constitution. Can you describe 
how you would approach this issue as a court of appeals judge?
    Justice Robinson. Thank you, Senator. I&#x27;d like to be clear 
that the case you&#x27;re describing was a case in which the court 
was applying the Vermont constitutional protection for the 
right to bear arms, so nothing about that decision purported to 
address the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution.
    The court did conclude in that case, and I joined the 
opinion, that Vermont&#x27;s State constitutional right to bear arms 
does include an individual right to bear arms for the 
protection of self, family, and home. That&#x27;s a conclusion that 
resonated with the conclusion that the U.S. Supreme Court 
reached in the Heller case with respect to the Second 
Amendment.
    Senator Feinstein. Thank you very much. Thanks, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Cruz.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome to the 
nominees. Justice Robinson, let me start with you. I am 
concerned about your record both as an advocate and as a 
Justice, that it demonstrates a marked hostility toward 
religious liberty.
    When you were in private practice, you wrote a brief in 
favor of forcing the Baker family, a Catholic family that owned 
a print shop, to print membership cards for a pro-abortion 
activist group. The Baker family believed that was in violation 
of their deeply held religious convictions. In your brief, you 
used strong and even incendiary language to describe the Baker 
family&#x27;s religious convictions. Referring to their views that 
they did not wish to actively advocate for and promote 
abortion, you referred to those religious views as invidious 
and pernicious.
    As you know, the very first clause of the First Amendment 
of the Constitution protects religious liberty. Given that 
history of litigating and attacking an exercise of religious 
liberty, how might a litigant in the Second Circuit have any 
confidence that as a judge, you would actually follow the law 
and, in particular, honor the religious liberty protections in 
the Constitution?
    Justice Robinson. Thank you, Senator Cruz. Just to put that 
case in context, and I don&#x27;t have all the details in my mind 
because it was 30 years ago, it was my very first year of 
practicing law in Vermont. The claim by my client was that she 
had been subject to discrimination on the basis of her 
religious conviction. In particular, she had asked to print 
cards for Vermont Catholics for Free Choice. Her contention was 
that the Bakers said, ``We won&#x27;t print these cards because we 
don&#x27;t think Catholics can be for choice.&#x27;&#x27; She brought a claim 
for discrimination on the basis of creed, and we acknowledge 
out of the blocks that if the facts show that the Bakers 
declined to print the placard because of their opposition to 
abortion rather than their belief that her strain of Catholic 
faith was wrong, then she wouldn&#x27;t have a claim.
    Senator Cruz. Hold on a second. I have to say you said that 
that clarifies things, but if anything, that makes it worse. 
Your argument was that if their view was this is the teaching 
of the Catholic Church, then that the courts should straighten 
them out and say, ``No, you don&#x27;t get to have your own 
understanding of the teaching of the Catholic Church, we&#x27;re 
going to force you to say the Catholic Church is pro-abortion, 
even if you don&#x27;t believe it is,&#x27;&#x27; is that right?
    Justice Robinson. Senator, the applicable law stated by 
Justice Scalia in his opinion in the Smith case was and remains 
that the--a neutral law of general applicability applies 
without----
    Senator Cruz. That&#x27;s why Congress passed the Religious 
Freedom Restoration Act----
    Justice Robinson. I understand----
    Senator Cruz. The overwhelming bipartisan majority of 
Congress concluded the Smith case did not adequately protect 
religious liberty. You likewise during a marriage law symposium 
said quote, ``Long after every State in this country allows 
same-sex couples to marry, there will still be churches that 
decline to recognize or celebrate same-sex marriage. We&#x27;re not 
suggesting that should be otherwise. Well, maybe it should be 
otherwise, but that&#x27;s not our mission.&#x27;&#x27;
    I find it quite astonishing as an advocate that you&#x27;re 
suggesting that the law has purview to force pastors and 
priests and rabbis to change what they teach as a matter of 
faith if it does not fit a political position that you happen 
to support.
    Justice Robinson. Senator Cruz, I would agree with you. 
That is not my position. I&#x27;m not familiar, as I sit here, with 
the exact context of those remarks, but when I was an advocate, 
our position was always that the debate about whether a 
particular religious community should or shouldn&#x27;t recognize 
marriages between same-sex couples was for the members of that 
religious community to decide. The question of whether the law 
should recognize marriages between same-sex couples was the 
only issue of concern for our advocates.
    Senator Cruz. Ms. Sung, do you believe Justice Kavanaugh is 
intellectually and morally bankrupt?
    Ms. Sung. Senator, I would want every Supreme Court Justice 
to know, including Justice Kavanaugh, that I respect completely 
their authority as a Supreme Court Justice, and I would follow 
their precedents without reservation.
    Senator Cruz. You&#x27;re an experienced lawyer, you know when 
someone&#x27;s not answering a question. My question was simple and 
straightforward. Do you believe Justice Kavanaugh is quote 
``Intellectually and morally bankrupt?&#x27;&#x27;
    Ms. Sung. Thank you for the question, Senator. As I stated 
earlier, I recognize that that statement was overheated 
rhetoric, and that&#x27;s all that it was.
    Senator Cruz. I&#x27;m going to try one more time because you 
signed your name to it, and it wasn&#x27;t year--decades ago, it was 
very recently. You signed your name to this statement. I&#x27;m 
asking simply today, do you believe that Justice Kavanaugh is, 
quote, ``intellectually and morally bankrupt?&#x27;&#x27; You signed your 
name to that proposition. Do you still believe it?
    Ms. Sung. Thank you for the question, Senator. As I stated, 
that was rhetorical advocacy only, that I signed strictly in my 
personal capacity as a private citizen addressing my alma 
mater. Throughout my legal career as a litigator, as an 
adjudicator, I have followed all of the Court&#x27;s precedents. I 
have respected every Justice----
    Senator Cruz. It is disappointing that you refuse to answer 
the question. It&#x27;s a simple yes, no question and three times 
you&#x27;ve refused to answer it.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Cruz. Senator Hirono.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I ask all nominees 
who come before any of my Committees the following two initial 
questions, which I will ask of both of you. Since you became a 
legal adult have you ever made unwanted requests for sexual 
favors or committed any verbal or physical harassment or 
assault of a sexual nature? Justice Robinson?
    Justice Robinson. No.
    Senator Hirono. Ms. Sung.
    Ms. Sung. No, Senator.
    Senator Hirono. Have you ever faced discipline or entered 
into a settlement related to this kind of conduct?
    Justice Robinson. No, Senator.
    Ms. Sung. No, Senator.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you. Justice Robinson, in the past, 
you have discussed how courts don&#x27;t live in a vacuum and are 
responsive to public opinion. You have also talked about the 
limitation of the court, no agenda setting, and the limited 
ability to weave love and compassion into work. Can you tell us 
about the role of public opinion, or personal experiences in 
judicial decision-making, and what role it has and what role it 
should have since you have said that judges don&#x27;t live in a 
vacuum?
    Justice Robinson. Thank you, Senator. I think in our 
constitutional democracy the courts have primary responsibility 
for the constitutional part. I think the elected branches are 
also responsible for ensuring that their acts comport with the 
Constitution, but that&#x27;s where the democracy part of our 
constitutional democracy lives.
    In deciding cases, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the role of the 
courts to think about how popular or unpopular our decision 
will be in a particular case. In my time on the court, I&#x27;ve 
been part of decisions that I knew would be unpopular, and we 
made the decisions because they were the decisions we felt the 
law compelled us to make.
    Senator Hirono. I&#x27;m trying to--okay, well, I am of the view 
that judges don&#x27;t get on the bench and forget about all their 
life experiences, and that they&#x27;re not just blank slates, and 
there are many times when in interpreting a law which you have 
to apply to the case, to the facts of a case, yes, I think--I 
think your experiences do come into play. For anyone to say 
otherwise, as many nominees previously have said, I think that 
is really kind of unbelievable. I&#x27;ll leave that.
    You also have a long record advocating for LGBTQ rights, 
including same-sex marriage, and you also have gone out of your 
way in your statements to defend a faith community&#x27;s right to 
set their own rules on who may marry. You were asked about 
your--your approach to religious freedom just now, and you were 
instrumental, for example, in including protections in a 
Vermont marriage equality bill, protections that were requested 
by religious leaders. Why was it important to address or 
protect religious liberty with respect to LGBTQ rights?
    Justice Robinson. Thank you, Senator. The discussion that 
you are referencing was, again, in my last role as an advocate, 
and it was part of the legislative give and take in Vermont 
legislature&#x27;s enactment of the first bill in the country, law 
in the country that extended marriage to same-sex couples, not 
as a result of a court decision.
    I&#x27;ve had one opportunity to deal directly with a First 
Amendment issue in my time on the bench, and in that case, it 
was a case that involved the question of whether a grant 
program that provided grants to community organizations that 
serve the community was off limit--whether a local church that 
served as a community center was off limits for that grant 
program. Following the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in the 
Trinity Lutheran case, we concluded that it was in a context of 
a preliminary injunction, so it wasn&#x27;t a direct decision on the 
merits, but that the claimants saying that the grant couldn&#x27;t 
be made were--faced steep headwinds in their claim.
    Senator Hirono. I would say that you do not have a 
hostility to religious liberty. Mr. Chairman, I would like to 
ask a few questions of Ms. Sung. If I could just go over, just 
a little bit, with your indulgence, I&#x27;d appreciate it. Thank 
you.
    Ms. Sung, I note that you said that you left behind the 
role of advocate when you joined the board. I think that is 
very significant because you have been asked questions about 
the letter that you signed onto. I do appreciate the fact that 
on this board where you have a lot of contentious cases because 
whenever you have employees and employers, or management and 
the employees, or unions, it tends to get very contentious. I 
note that the other two members of the board have cited your 
ability to be very fair in how you come down on these kinds of 
very contentious--although they can be somewhat boring, no 
offense. I&#x27;ve had to deal with some of those issues myself in 
the legislature. I think it is also significant that they have 
noted that you have an ability to be very fair and open minded 
in how you decide your cases.
    I also would like to note that you have a lot of support 
from communities of color. You&#x27;d be only the third API woman on 
any Federal circuit. It&#x27;s kind of astounding that there are 
only 11 APIs serving out of a total of 179 authorized Federal 
appellate court judges. How important is diversity to the 
Federal court system do you think?
    Ms. Sung. Thank you for the question, Senator. I think that 
diversity of all kinds is important to our Federal judiciary 
because it enhances the public confidence and trust that the 
judiciary, as a whole, is impartial and well-balanced. I think 
I sit on a board that is professionally diverse by design, and 
I know from speaking with the stakeholders that are affected by 
our decisions that their trust in our board&#x27;s impartiality is 
greatly enhanced by that diversity on our board, and as well as 
our collegiality. I think that we work hard to reach consensus 
whenever possible, and that also inspires public confidence in 
the impartiality of our decisions.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you. I couldn&#x27;t agree with you more. 
Mr. Chairman, with your indulgence, I would like to ask 
unanimous consent to introduce into the record a letter that I 
have from NAPABA, the National Asian Pacific American Bar 
Association.
    Chair Durbin. Without objection, it will be entered into 
the record.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you.
    [The information appears as a submission for the record.]
    Chair Durbin. Thank you very much Senator Hirono. I believe 
that Senator Tillis by order of arrival is next up on the 
Republican side. Senator.
    Senator Tillis. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you both for 
being here and congratulations on your nomination. Judge 
Robinson, you responded to Senator Hirono&#x27;s question about--you 
said in your opening statement, I believe, or in response to 
Senator Durbin&#x27;s question, how you had a political life and 
that you flipped the switch and became a judge--you want me to 
get that for you? You responded in a way that said that you 
couldn&#x27;t really allow your past political positions to 
influence matters of law. I&#x27;m not sure that that satisfied 
Senator Hirono, but it did satisfy me.
    You also said that there were some cases that you ruled 
that you knew were potentially unpopular. Can you think of any 
cases where, as a matter of law and the facts in the case, you 
came down on a position that may have differed from the 
position you would&#x27;ve taken in the political chapter of your 
life?
    Justice Robinson. I can&#x27;t think of a case specifically that 
conflicted with, I think, what you&#x27;re describing with the 
political chapter of my life. It&#x27;s not uncommon at all for all 
of us on the court to express to one another that this is a 
decision that we feel compelled to make, either because of the 
law, or because of the record that comes up to us from the 
trial court, which makes findings that, as we review the 
record, may not have been the findings we&#x27;d made. I&#x27;m not--I&#x27;m 
not, as I sit here today, able to start naming specific ones in 
part because I think as a sitting judge it would be imprudent 
for me to tell you, ``Oh, I made this decision in this case, 
but I wish I didn&#x27;t have to.&#x27;&#x27;
    Senator Tillis. You also mentioned, I think, in one case 
about a religious freedom matter where you were sympathetic, I 
believe, to the religious--the religious leaders who were 
trying to limit who they would actually have to provide marital 
services to. Is that true?
    Justice Robinson. I&#x27;m sorry, Senator Tillis. I think that 
was a reference to something from the sort of advocacy chapter.
    Senator Tillis. Yes.
    Justice Robinson. I&#x27;m not entirely sure there was--I&#x27;m not 
sure.
    Senator Tillis. Okay, I may have misunderstood it, but I do 
know, I think, that you were involved--were you involved in the 
case--Ms. Sung, it may be you. I may get my record confused 
here. It was one where you were advocating for a--I think it 
was Regal Printing. In Regal Printing, that was a case where 
you were actually advocating for the printing against the 
objections of the owners of Regal Printing?
    Justice Robinson. Yes, and this is the case that Senator 
Cruz and I spoke about earlier. Again, this was 30 years ago, I 
was brand new as a lawyer, so my memory is not--I don&#x27;t want to 
be accountable for all the details. The competing claims in 
that case was that our client was claiming that she had been 
denied service from a public accommodation on account of her 
religious beliefs. The defense was, ``No, we denied you service 
because we didn&#x27;t want to print a pro-abortion thing. Oh, and 
we also have a First Amendment defense.&#x27;&#x27; We never got--we 
never resolved either the factual issue or the First Amendment 
defense because the case ultimately settled, but that was the 
context of the case.
    Senator Tillis. Ms. Sung, Ms. Robinson, Ms. Sung, it would 
be your time I guess as you clerked in the Ninth Circuit, or 
Ms. Robinson, have either of y&#x27;all had any experience with 
intellectual property matters? I&#x27;m the Ranking Member on the 
Intellectual Property Subcommittee. I personally think there&#x27;s 
a lot of jurisprudence that needs to be reworked. I was just 
curious if you have any insights into IP matters that may come. 
Ms. Sung, we&#x27;ll go to you.
    Ms. Sung. Not the level of expertise that would be the type 
of experience I think that would be helpful.
    Senator Tillis. Okay, I was just with your time on the 
circuit I just didn&#x27;t know if maybe something had gone through 
your office. Ms. Robinson.
    Justice Robinson. Yes, Senator Tillis. I had--I had 
occasional dabbling with copyright issues, but nothing that 
would cause me to think of myself as expert. I put that in the 
category of the type of thing I&#x27;d look forward to learning if I 
had the opportunity to serve on the Second Circuit.
    Senator Tillis. There&#x27;s a lot of work to be done, and I 
think Senator Leahy agrees with that. We look forward to, at 
least, having a Congress way into it.
    Just a final comment. Ms. Sung, on the letter, have you 
thought about aspiring to being a judge for some time, or was 
this a surprise nomination?
    Ms. Sung. I would say it&#x27;s fair to characterize it as a 
surprise nomination.
    Senator Tillis. I just think that, you know, given the--I 
had a discussion with a nominee last night about I don&#x27;t really 
buy into this going back 30 years and criticizing somebody for 
making an ill-advised statement that maybe they regret today.
    The letter does concern me because you&#x27;re obviously a very 
well-educated, very bright person. You had to have at least 
assumed that it would not be viewed just in the context of a 
communication to your alma mater, that it would come out. It 
does raise some concerns in my mind about temperament or maybe 
predisposition, but I&#x27;ll just leave it at that. I&#x27;m not going 
to grill you on any questions. Thank you both for being here.
    Ms. Sung. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Senator Tillis. Senator Blumenthal.
    Senator Leahy. Mr. Chairman, before he starts, Senator 
Tillis and I have quite an agenda in Intellectual Property. I&#x27;m 
glad you raised that issue, thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Blumenthal.
    Senator Blumenthal. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Thank you both 
for your service and your willingness to continue to serve. 
Justice Robinson, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals is very 
close to my heart, having appeared before it numerous times, 
and having great respect for the quality of scholarship and 
courage of many of its decisions, which I know you will 
continue to uphold as a tradition. I respect your experience, 
nearly 1,800 decisions on the Vermont Supreme Court, which has 
a great tradition also of scholarship and excellence.
    I&#x27;d like to ask you how your experience as a litigator and 
an advocate has shaped your performance as a judge because I 
happen to think that experience as a litigator and an advocate 
is important to a judge. At the same time, obviously, you have 
to separate advocacy from judging. How do you do that in terms 
of compartmentalizing the two experiences, but drawing on one 
to benefit the other?
    Justice Robinson. Thank you, Senator. I think you can&#x27;t be 
a successful litigator without being well-steeped in the law, 
and without being able to do good legal analysis. I think that 
practicing as a litigator is the right training ground for 
somebody to become a judge.
    You&#x27;re right that the transition from an advocacy role to a 
judicial role is a significant one. For me, what made it easy 
is I was motivated as an advocate because I was passionate 
about the clients I represented and the causes that I advocated 
for. I am, as a judge, passionately committed to the rule of 
law and my duty to uphold it from the bench. I carry that same 
sense of mission in a different role, and that has made the 
transition easy for me.
    Senator Blumenthal. Do you feel that you can separate the 
advocacy that you may have done? I know my colleagues have 
asked you this question in various different ways, but I&#x27;d like 
to give you another opportunity to answer it.
    Justice Robinson. Thank you, Senator Blumenthal. I&#x27;ve 
written over 310 opinions. I&#x27;ve participated in nearly 1,800 
decisions in my time on the Vermont Supreme Court. I&#x27;m quite 
sure that no one person in this room will agree with every 
position I&#x27;ve taken and every opinion I&#x27;ve written, but I hope 
that a thorough review of my record would support my own belief 
that I try in every case to be even-handed with fidelity to the 
law, and I try to bring rigorous legal analysis to the cases 
before me.
    Senator Blumenthal. Let me ask you kind of a loaded 
question. You can feel free to avoid answering it, but I happen 
to feel we need more judges at the district court level, 
possibly even the circuit court level. Do you have any views on 
that issue?
    Justice Robinson. Senator Blumenthal, I--because I don&#x27;t 
currently serve in the Federal system, I&#x27;m not in a position to 
weigh in based on any kind of personal experience.
    Senator Blumenthal. My thought especially because you&#x27;re 
currently not in the Federal system you might weigh in on it, 
but that&#x27;s fine.
    Ms. Sung, tell me, what is it that you will look forward to 
most about being on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals?
    Ms. Sung. Thank you for the question, Senator. I think I 
will look forward to most continuing my work as a neutral 
adjudicator in the sense of diligently reviewing cases and 
researching the law, and impartially applying the law to the 
facts of the record while working collegially with other judges 
to hopefully reach consensus about what the correct result in 
the case is.
    Because I already serve as a neutral adjudicator, I would 
say the one other thing I would especially look forward to out 
in the circuit is the opportunity to work on the wide range of 
issues that are presented to the circuit. I have, throughout my 
career, dealt with a variety of subject areas, including 
constitutional law, and the opportunity to serve as a judge 
responsible for deciding those types of issues would be a great 
responsibility and something I think I would particularly also 
enjoy.
    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Blumenthal. Senator Cruz. 
I&#x27;m sorry, Senator Cornyn.
    Senator Grassley. Senior Senator.
    Chair Durbin. The senior Senator from Texas.
    Senator Leahy. The better-looking one.
    Senator Cornyn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge and Ms. 
Sung, I want to ask you about an article. Actually, it&#x27;s an 
opinion piece that Linda Greenhouse, longtime reporter covering 
the Supreme Court of the United States wrote in The New York 
Times on September 9th, 2021. The title of the article is ``God 
Has No Place in Supreme Court Opinions.&#x27;&#x27; She goes on among 
other things to talk about the Court&#x27;s abortion jurisprudence.
    I would just like to ask both of you, do you believe that 
when life begins, Judge and Ms. Sung, is a religious question? 
Is it a legal question? Is a scientific question? Is it a 
philosophical question? Or is it a political question, or some 
other category that I haven&#x27;t mentioned? Judge?
    Justice Robinson. Thank you, Senator Cornyn. I think those 
are important questions, and I will say that as a sitting judge 
and as a nominee for the Second Circuit, it wouldn&#x27;t be 
appropriate for me in this setting to offer an opinion as to 
the framework for evaluating that question. What I can tell----
    Senator Cornyn. No, I&#x27;m not asking you in the context of 
deciding a case, I&#x27;m asking you what your personal opinion is 
about when life begins. Whether it&#x27;s a religious, legal, 
scientific, philosophical, or political question.
    Justice Robinson. No, I understand that Senator Cornyn. My 
concern is that if faced with a case that involved a challenge 
to restriction, I would be obligated to follow the precedents 
of the U.S. Supreme Court, and statements that I might make 
today as to how that question should be evaluated could 
suggest----
    Senator Cornyn. You&#x27;re not going to answer the question. I 
understand that. The, you know, the circuit that you will be 
sitting on will be the court of last resort for many cases. As 
you know, the Supreme Court of the United States only hears 
roughly 80 cases a year. You will be, in effect, sitting on the 
Supreme Court for all practical purposes for a number of cases. 
I think it&#x27;s a fair question.
    Let me just ask you under the Supreme Court&#x27;s 
jurisprudence, and I&#x27;m asking you now as a legal 
interpretation, does the question of when life begins, is that 
relevant to a legal discussion about abortion rights?
    Justice Robinson. Senator, as I read the Court&#x27;s current 
case law, viability is the touchstone of the legal framework 
that the Court has built. I don&#x27;t understand it to weigh into 
questions of when life begins from that perspective.
    Senator Cornyn. The question of viability, or when life 
begins, is an important legal question under the Supreme 
Court&#x27;s jurisprudence. Do you agree with that?
    Justice Robinson. Yes.
    Senator Cornyn. Okay. I guess do you know who--where the 
court--Ms. Sung, you&#x27;ll be sitting on the Ninth Circuit Court 
of Appeals. Where does the Supreme Court look to determine the 
question of when life begins?
    Ms. Sung. Thank you for the question, Senator. As I recall 
from the Court&#x27;s current jurisprudence on the issue, they look 
to scientific evidence to determine when a fetus is viable.
    Senator Cornyn. Would that be the state of scientific 
evidence back when Roe v. Wade was decided, or would that be 
the state of science today?
    Ms. Sung. My understanding from the course of the Court&#x27;s 
jurisprudence is that it has, to an extent, moved--recognized 
that scientific advances can change the point at which a fetus 
is viable.
    Senator Cornyn. Judge Robinson, do you believe that an 
unborn child, at any point up until the time the child is 
delivered by the mother, does that child have rights under the 
Supreme Court precedent?
    Justice Robinson. I believe that the Supreme Court, in 
general terms, has recognized that after the point of 
viability, one of the interests that is within the scope of 
permissible regulation for the State is the interest of the 
fetus that would be born as a child.
    Senator Cornyn. Do you agree with that, Ms. Sung?
    Ms. Sung. That is also my understanding of the Court&#x27;s 
jurisprudence.
    Senator Cornyn. The question of viability or when life 
begins is an important issue because if the fetus is viable, 
then the fetus has rights that can be protected by the State; 
correct? Judge?
    Justice Robinson. Senator, in broadly general terms, yes.
    Senator Cornyn. You agree with that, Ms. Sung?
    Ms. Sung. Yes.
    Senator Cornyn. I won&#x27;t ask you this question, but I&#x27;ll 
just close on this. We&#x27;ll maybe continue the conversation. 
Seven out of 198 countries in the world allow abortion after 20 
weeks. I presume the basis for those decisions is when they 
believe the fetus is a question of viability we&#x27;ve been talking 
about here. The United States finds itself among those seven 
countries: North Korea, Vietnam, China, and Singapore, Canada, 
and the Netherlands. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you very much. Senator Kennedy.
    Senator Cornyn. Mr. Chairman, can I ask unanimous consent 
that this article be made part of the record?
    [The information appears as a submission for the record.]
    Chair Durbin. Without objection. Senator Kennedy.
    Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If you could 
indulge me, I&#x27;d like a couple extra minutes, too, if it&#x27;s okay.
    Chair Durbin. Certainly.
    Senator Kennedy. Counselor, did you really say that Justice 
Kavanaugh was a morally bankrupt person?
    Ms. Sung. Senator, as I explained, I did not write that 
letter. I did sign it. I take----
    Senator Kennedy. Did you read it?
    Ms. Sung. I read it quickly, yes.
    Senator Kennedy. You signed it?
    Ms. Sung. Yes, sir.
    Senator Kennedy. Did you really say that Justice Kavanaugh, 
if he would--was confirmed, would cause people to die?
    Ms. Sung. As I stated, Senator, I understood those 
statements were overheated rhetoric, but I understood them to 
be just that, rhetorical.
    Senator Kennedy. Yes, but you said it. You said it, right?
    Ms. Sung. I did sign the letter, yes Senator.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. Do you believe that Brett 
Kavanaugh&#x27;s a morally bankrupt person?
    Ms. Sung. Senator, sitting here as a judicial nominee, it 
is not appropriate for me to comment----
    Senator Kennedy. Do you believe----
    Ms. Sung [continuing]. Personally on any Justice.
    Senator Kennedy. You said it. You said it. Do you believe 
that he&#x27;s a morally bankrupt person?
    Ms. Sung. Senator, it is not appropriate for----
    Senator Kennedy. Why not?
    Ms. Sung [continuing]. Me to comment----
    Senator Kennedy. You said it.
    Ms. Sung. I understand----
    Chair Durbin. Senator, I am giving you extra time, but can 
she be allowed to answer?
    Senator Kennedy. Sure, I just want an answer. I agree that 
she should answer. You&#x27;re not going to answer my question?
    Ms. Sung. I believe I&#x27;ve answered it to the best of my 
ability, honestly, Senator. I respect completely the 
confirmation process and the authority of Justice Kavanaugh and 
every Supreme Court Justice.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay, but do you--this is real simple. You 
said, just a few years ago--you weren&#x27;t in law school. You 
weren&#x27;t in college. You said Brett Kavanaugh is a morally 
bankrupt person. It&#x27;s clear as thunder on a summer night. 
You&#x27;re under oath. Do you believe he is or not? How hard is 
that? You&#x27;ll have much harder questions as a Federal judge if 
you can make it that far.
    Ms. Sung. I appreciate the question, Senator. As I stated, 
those statements were rhetorical advocacy that I signed as an 
alum addressing my law school alma mater. I did not----
    Senator Kennedy. Let me ask you about this rhetorical 
advocacy. Does rhetorical advocacy mean you said something, but 
now that you&#x27;ve been nominated, you&#x27;re scared that you can&#x27;t 
get the vote, so you&#x27;re going to try not to answer the 
question? Is that what rhetorical advocacy means? What is 
rhetorical advocacy? Is it a lie?
    Ms. Sung. No, it&#x27;s not a lie, Senator. I would say that 
it&#x27;s statements that are made in service of an advocacy 
position.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. If you issue an opinion, and you get 
reversed by the Supreme Court, are you just going to say, ``Oh, 
don&#x27;t worry about it, Justices. That was just rhetorical 
advocacy?&#x27;&#x27; What is this?
    Ms. Sung. Absolutely not, Senator. If the Court issues an 
opinion, as a lower court judge, I would be absolutely bound to 
follow it. It is not merely rhetorical advocacy; it is the law 
of the land.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay, let me try one more time. Do you 
believe that Brett Kavanaugh is a morally bankrupt person?
    Ms. Sung. Senator, as I----
    Senator Kennedy. Sitting here today, under oath.
    Ms. Sung. Sitting here today, under oath, I can assure that 
I respect completely the authority of Justice Kavanaugh as a 
duly confirmed Supreme Court Justice of the United States.
    Senator Kennedy. Yes, ma&#x27;am, but do you believe he&#x27;s 
morally bankrupt?
    Ms. Sung. Senator, as I stated, I respect his authority and 
the authority of every Supreme Court Justice sitting on our 
Court.
    Senator Kennedy. Yes, ma&#x27;am, but do you believe he&#x27;s 
morally bankrupt?
    Ms. Sung. My personal opinion is not for me--is not 
appropriate for me to say. I respect his authority as a Supreme 
Court Justice----
    Senator Kennedy. You think he is morally bankrupt.
    Ms. Sung. I did not say that Senator.
    Senator Kennedy. You signed the letter saying he was 
morally bankrupt.
    Ms. Sung. Several years ago, as an alum addressing my law 
school alma mater, I did sign a letter that, I believed, was 
addressed only to my law school administration----
    Senator Kennedy. You didn&#x27;t think it would be public.
    Ms. Sung. I did not understand that it would be used as a 
public advocacy piece, no. I believed it was only addressed to 
my law school administration.
    Senator Kennedy. You signed that because--because you 
wanted to show fidelity to your alma mater, Yale Law School?
    Ms. Sung. I signed it, Senator, at the time because I felt 
that it was an appropriate statement to make to my law school 
administration, notwithstanding the overheated rhetoric. 
Sitting here today, as a judicial nominee, what I want to 
assure you is that, as an advocate, as a litigator, as a 
neutral adjudicator, and as a judge, if confirmed, I would 
absolutely respect the authority of every Supreme Court Justice 
and all of its precedents without reservation.
    Senator Kennedy. See, I don&#x27;t believe you. I think you 
said--I think you allowed your political beliefs to cloud your 
judgment and I think you said a few years ago what you said 
about Brett Kavanaugh, and I think you believe it. I can&#x27;t 
imagine what it&#x27;s going to be like to be a litigant in front of 
you with that demonstration of lack of judicial temperament and 
judgment. How can a litigant possibly think that you&#x27;re not 
going to act on personal beliefs if you were so intemperate to 
say something like this?
    Last question. Are you proud of the fact that Yale Law 
School has a quota system limiting the number of Asian 
Americans? Have you ever written a letter about that? Or does 
that not--where does that fit in your socioeconomic view of the 
world that you think everybody else should adopt, and you will 
impose if you&#x27;re in a position of power?
    Ms. Sung. Senator, I&#x27;m not aware of any policy like that, 
but what I can assure you is that I have a track record as----
    Senator Kennedy. You need to get out more.
    Ms. Sung. I have a track record as a neutral adjudicator. I 
have decided cases for nearly five years impartially by 
applying the law as set forth in our statutes, our 
constitution, and our precedents, and I have applied that law 
impartially. I have ruled without----
    Senator Kennedy. You&#x27;re the only person in the Milky Way 
who believes you&#x27;re impartial.
    Senator Leahy. Mr. Chairman can we----
    Senator Kennedy. I&#x27;m done, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Leahy. Yes, you are. Mr. Chairman, I note that 
the--there seems to be this idea that, especially if we have a 
woman nominee, you can interrupt her any time you want to state 
your own things. She&#x27;s answered this question over and over 
again. I would hope that we get back and show some respect to 
those who are answering questions under oath.
    Chair Durbin. Thank----
    Senator Kennedy. Mr. Chairman, since my name&#x27;s been 
invoked, Senator Leahy knows how much I admire and respect him. 
I resent the suggestion that I&#x27;m doing that because she&#x27;s a 
woman. I would be doing it if she made those intemperate 
remarks as a male. I don&#x27;t believe the Senator has any evidence 
to show that I&#x27;m somehow being misogynistic. I have respect for 
the rule of law, whether it&#x27;s by a male or a female. Gender has 
nothing to do with it.
    Senator Leahy. I have respect for this Committee, but I 
also look at the record of how the votes go on nominees, and 
I&#x27;ve seen in my years here, which is longer than anybody else 
on this, I&#x27;ve seen a disproportionate number of votes--I&#x27;m not 
referencing any particular Senator. You can go back and look at 
your own record. A disproportionate number of votes against 
women and people of color, especially women of color. I&#x27;ve seen 
that. I&#x27;ve mentioned that before without mentioning any 
particular Senator.
    Every Senator has the right to vote as they want, but let&#x27;s 
all stop and think of what we&#x27;re doing. I&#x27;ve heard Senators 
talk about, ``Well, Democrats are against any nominee, any 
Republican nominee to the Supreme Court.&#x27;&#x27; I&#x27;d ask any 
Senator--Republican Senator, show me a Republican Senator who&#x27;s 
voted for more Republican nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court 
than I have. I don&#x27;t think there is one.
    Senator Kennedy. Mr. Chairman, let me respond to that. 
Senator Leahy knows how much I respect him, and I do, more than 
I can--there aren&#x27;t words in English. I don&#x27;t care how long 
he&#x27;s been here. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any evidence in this 
record to show that I have voted on a nominee on the basis of 
race or gender, and I resent that.
    Chair Durbin. We&#x27;re going to terminate this conversation 
and go back to the business of the Committee, and I believe 
that Senator Blackburn is the next person up for questioning. 
Senator Blackburn.
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate 
that. Justice Robinson, I&#x27;d like to begin with you. The Second 
Circuit is one of the most important forums for securities law, 
antitrust--which is an important issue we&#x27;re looking at in this 
Committee--complex commercial litigation, shareholder class 
actions.
    To date, you have participated in over 1,800 matters, but 
none of them, not a one, appear to be securities, shareholder 
class actions, commercial litigation, corporate entities, 
complex financial transactions. Given this, if you were to be 
confirmed, what are your plans to familiarize yourself with 
these areas of the law?
    Justice Robinson. Thank you, Senator Blackburn. It&#x27;s true 
that I have had some cases that involve commercial litigation 
more broadly speaking, but I agree that most of the subject 
areas you listed are matters of focus in the Federal courts. I 
can tell you that in my 10 years on the Vermont Supreme Court, 
I found that, A, I really like learning new things. I like 
broadening my horizons. And B, I enjoy complexity. When cases 
come in that some people look at and say, ``Oh my gosh,&#x27;&#x27; and 
they look at the record, I get excited. I think that that 
disposition is something that would serve me well in trying to 
expand my knowledge on the Second Circuit.
    Senator Blackburn. All right, then let me ask you about 
this judicial activism. I want to talk with you about that. You 
made a statement at an ABA panel where you said court decisions 
can catalyze broader social and legal change. What does 
judicial activism mean to you, and do you think it&#x27;s 
appropriate?
    Justice Robinson. Thank you, Senator Blackburn. I don&#x27;t use 
the term judicial activism because it has very different 
meanings to different people.
    Senator Blackburn. Okay. Then you have no answer to that.
    Justice Robinson. I&#x27;m sorry, I thought the question was: 
What does judicial activism mean to me? I don&#x27;t----
    Senator Blackburn. All right. You see decisions as driving 
broader social change, but then you do not interpret that as 
being judicial activism?
    Justice Robinson. Senator, I think the role of courts is to 
decide the cases that come before them pursuant to the law that 
they apply.
    Senator Blackburn. One of the things that Tennesseans don&#x27;t 
appreciate is having activists on the court. They want that to 
be a neutral body, and that&#x27;s what they expect.
    Ms. Sung, I want to come to you. Going back to this letter 
that you signed. What you&#x27;re saying is that it is a heat of the 
moment decision that you made, that probably you exercised poor 
judgment, and it&#x27;s difficult for you to separate that personal 
from your professional, as you signed that in your professional 
capacity. Would I be correct on that?
    Ms. Sung. Thank you for the question, Senator. To be clear, 
I signed that letter strictly in my personal capacity.
    Senator Blackburn. Okay, so you did that in your personal 
capacity. Okay. In the letter, I want to go to this. You said 
that you thought he was a ``threat to the most vulnerable.&#x27;&#x27; 
That&#x27;s a quote, and ``that he&#x27;s a threat to many of us,&#x27;&#x27; and 
the letter went on to say that ``people will die if he is 
confirmed.&#x27;&#x27; Why don&#x27;t you talk to me about who is the ``us&#x27;&#x27; 
that Kavanaugh is a threat to? Who are the people that you 
expected to die if Kavanaugh was confirmed? I mean, this is a 
pretty broad, brazen accusation. It&#x27;s pretty out there. Why 
don&#x27;t you bring some clarity to that?
    Ms. Sung. Thank you for the question, Senator. I agree that 
those statements were overheated rhetoric, and as I stated 
before, if by signing the letter, I created the impression that 
I, as a judge, if confirmed, would fail to respect the 
authority of the Justice, then I do apologize.
    Senator Blackburn. Let&#x27;s view the premise that you 
created--you created that. You created that perception. Many 
times, people believe perception is reality. You&#x27;ve established 
that as your thought process that you as a person in your 
personal capacity, you say, not in your professional capacity, 
but you as a person, in your heart of hearts, you think here is 
someone who is unacceptable. He is a threat to us, but you 
still haven&#x27;t defined ``us.&#x27;&#x27; He is someone who will, himself, 
cause people to die. If you don&#x27;t want to bring clarity to that 
for me, then by signing that letter, have you proven yourself 
to be unacceptable as a nominee for a Federal judgeship?
    Ms. Sung. Thank you for the question, Senator. I think the 
best evidence of the kind of judge I would be, if confirmed, is 
my track record as a neutral adjudicator. As a neutral 
adjudicator, I have decided cases impartially by applying the 
law to the facts as established by the evidence and the record. 
I have----
    Senator Blackburn. Okay, let&#x27;s talk about that. During your 
11--and, by the way, you&#x27;ve still not answered the question on 
this. You&#x27;re kicking the can on the road. You&#x27;re punting on it. 
You should know that that is not something that is acceptable, 
and until you can clear the record on that, it is going to 
bring that perception to bear in how people perceive your 
thought process to be. I think it needs a little bit further 
discussion----
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Blackburn. Your time is 
expired.
    Senator Blackburn. Oh. Okay, thank you, I&#x27;m sorry. My clock 
isn&#x27;t working over here. Thank you. I have questions I&#x27;ll 
submit to you for the record about your judicial record and the 
number of times you&#x27;ve actually been in Federal court.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you. I believe Senator Lee is next by 
order of arrival.
    Senator Lee. Ms. Sung, I wasn&#x27;t personally intending to ask 
you about the letter. I was wanting to ask about other things. 
Some of your answers have me confused. When you call someone an 
``intellectually bankrupt ideologue who is intent on rolling 
back our rights and the rights of our clients,&#x27;&#x27; you either 
mean that or you don&#x27;t. I assume you would agree with me that 
if you&#x27;re speaking of someone that way, and you don&#x27;t believe 
that, you don&#x27;t have a reason to think that, it would be 
defamatory. Would it not?
    Ms. Sung. Sorry. Thank you for the question, Senator. As I 
stated, I did not write those statements. I take responsibility 
for signing the letter, and I do recognize that they were 
overheated rhetoric.
    Senator Lee. I understand that Ms. Sung, but I&#x27;m asking 
would those be defamatory if they were not true?
    Ms. Sung. The definition of defamation and the standards 
for defamation are complicated, but they vary depending on 
whether someone is a public figure. They vary in terms of 
whether they were statements of fact, and whether they can be 
proven or disproven.
    Senator Lee. He was, in fact, a sitting judge at the time 
you made the statement, and so it&#x27;s not that you&#x27;re pulling 
them from the air. You were purporting to have some knowledge 
of it. It&#x27;s not just that you said he was a ``morally bankrupt 
ideologue&#x27;&#x27; who would deprive people of rights; you also said 
people will die if he is confirmed. There&#x27;s no qualifying 
language in there. Nothing saying, ``We fear that this might 
result in decisions which could in turn result in things that 
would be bad for people.&#x27;&#x27; You called him, quote, ``A threat to 
the most vulnerable.&#x27;&#x27; Quote, ``He is a threat to many of us 
simply because of who we are.&#x27;&#x27; If you were saying that of 
someone, and you didn&#x27;t believe it was true, and you didn&#x27;t 
have a reason to make such a statement, wouldn&#x27;t that be 
defamatory?
    Ms. Sung. Respectfully, Senator, there&#x27;s requirements for 
defamation. It would require statements of fact, not mere 
rhetorical advocacy----
    Senator Lee. ``People will die if he is confirmed.&#x27;&#x27; Is 
that not a statement of fact? It&#x27;s not couched in language of 
opinion. It&#x27;s not couched in any logical syllogism. You&#x27;re 
talking about how this might lead to things. Nor is it 
ambiguous to say that, ``He is an intellectually and morally 
bankrupt ideologue intent on rolling back our rights and the 
rights of our clients.&#x27;&#x27; Let&#x27;s just start with that one. 
Wouldn&#x27;t you agree that that&#x27;s defamatory if not true?
    Ms. Sung. Appreciate the question, Senator. As I stated 
when I signed the letter, I understood those statements to be 
rhetorical advocacy, not statements of fact. I under----
    Senator Lee. Rhetorical advocacy is not a defense to 
defamation, not at common law, not under the law of any State 
with which I&#x27;m familiar. Can you tell me how that&#x27;s relevant to 
my question?
    Ms. Sung. Respectfully, Senator, as I stated before, I did 
not consider those to be statements of fact. I----
    Senator Lee. Then--okay, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a defense, 
ever, to a claim of defamation to say, ``I didn&#x27;t intend that 
as a statement of fact,&#x27;&#x27; if, in fact, you&#x27;re making statements 
of fact. Nor are these things just rooted in the ether. You&#x27;re 
not purporting to draw from them in the--in the absence of any 
context. You&#x27;re drawing from it, apparently, in the context of 
his status as a then sitting judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the D.C. Circuit. Is that not itself undermining the 
legitimacy of the courts as an officer of the court? Is that 
the sort of thing you aspire to?
    Ms. Sung. Senator, as I stated, I do apologize if by 
signing that letter I created the impression that I don&#x27;t 
respect the authority of the courts or any duly confirmed 
Supreme Court Justice. Throughout my legal career, as a 
litigator, as an adjudicator, and as a judge, if confirmed, I 
would respect the authority of every Supreme Court Justice. I 
have followed the Court&#x27;s precedents without reservation. I 
have applied them as an adjudicator, and I would continue to do 
so as a judge, if confirmed.
    Senator Lee. When you describe his nomination as a threat 
to the most vulnerable and as creating an emergency, that 
tends, inevitably, to suggest that your confidence in him is so 
lacking that someone would be justified in doing anything they 
could to undermine his judicial authority.
    I fail to see, as I read this letter, any caveat, any 
reservation, anything saying, ``Warning, we don&#x27;t really mean 
this.&#x27;&#x27; One of two things has got to be true. Either you didn&#x27;t 
believe these things, in which case you defamed him, or you did 
believe this thing, in which case I find it very difficult to 
believe that you&#x27;re going to be able to respect his rulings as 
you will be bound to respect, given that he&#x27;s sitting on the 
Supreme Court of the United States.
    I&#x27;d add, finally, Mr. Chairman, I think it&#x27;s important that 
we be able to ask these questions, and people can have 
legitimate concerns about a candidate without having our 
motives questions and without having our motives questioned 
particularly in the context where someone has questioned the 
motives of a member of the Supreme Court of the United States. 
I find this troubling. It&#x27;s a troubling trend on the Committee, 
and it&#x27;s not one that we should aspire to continue.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Lee, I believe the record will show 
there have been ample opportunities to ask a question about 
that letter this morning. The Chair has not cutoff anyone, nor 
do I plan on it. Senator Hawley.
    Senator Hawley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to the 
nominees for being here. Congratulations on your nomination. 
Justice Robinson, if I could just start with you. I have to say 
I&#x27;m troubled by your history of compelling individuals to 
express pro-abortion viewpoints against their religious 
convictions. I&#x27;m talking about the Regal Art Press case. I 
think Senator Cruz asked you a few questions about it.
    You represented Linda Paquette in 1994, who demanded that 
two devout Catholics print custom membership cards for an 
organization that advocated in favor of abortions. When they 
declined to do so, citing the teachings of their church, you 
and your client filed a complaint with the Vermont Human Rights 
Commission and then a lawsuit. In your briefs, you argued that 
their decision not to print those materials was invidious, it 
was pernicious, and it was akin to racial discrimination, which 
is quite a claim. I mean, it&#x27;s really quite a claim.
    I have to ask you, why did you feel it was important to 
leverage the machinery of government. This is a private 
business. These are two private individuals. Why did you feel 
it was important to leverage the machinery of government to 
force these two Catholic business owners to violate their 
sincerely held religious convictions? Help me understand this.
    Justice Robinson. Thank you, Senator Hawley. As I indicated 
with Senator Cruz, that case was 30 years ago, so I apologize 
if I&#x27;m not as precise about all the details. I can tell you, 
generally speaking, that we conceded that if the printers had 
declined to print the materials on account of their opposition 
to abortion, that there was no basis in law to pursue our 
claim. The issue--the threshold issue in the case is whether 
that, in fact, was the facts.
    My client was a Catholic. She was there to get flyers for 
Vermont Catholics for Choice printed. She was deeply offended 
by the suggestion that she wasn&#x27;t a true Catholic, and that was 
the reason why the printer wouldn&#x27;t print the materials. The 
case never proceeded beyond that stage. We went up to the 
supreme court on what I would call a procedural issue, we went 
back down, and the case settled. That was the end of it.
    Senator Hawley. I can understand the issue if the 
government had told your client that she wasn&#x27;t a true 
Catholic, or a true Hindu, or a true whatever, given our First 
Amendment, but we&#x27;re talking here about a suit against two 
private individuals, a husband and wife, I believe, Malcolm and 
Susan Baker, who on the basis of their religious viewpoints 
said that they couldn&#x27;t print these cards, and you and your 
client attempted to leverage the machinery of the State. In 
fact, you were the ones trying to use the machinery of the 
State to compel these two private individuals to speak.
    Of course, the Supreme Court has addressed this fact 
pattern in the Masterpiece Cakeshop case since that time, which 
concerned compelled speech. In light of Masterpiece Cakeshop, 
do you acknowledge today that your client would not have the 
right to compel other individuals to speak in a way that she 
favors?
    Justice Robinson. Senator Hawley, I don&#x27;t read the 
Masterpiece Cake decision as altering the Smith holding, that 
neutral laws of general applicability apply without regard to a 
free exercise defense, nor do I understand the Court to have 
resolved the speech claim. As I read the Masterpiece Cake 
decision, it turned on the fact that the Court concluded that 
the process of the Colorado Civil Rights Commission evinced 
hostility toward religion, and it wasn&#x27;t, in fact, a neutral 
law of general applicability in that respect.
    Senator Hawley. I think this is an important point. What 
you&#x27;re telling me is your view and your understanding of the 
law is, is that the law can, in fact, compel people of 
religious faith to speak against their own faith and their own 
viewpoint. The law can do that. If it&#x27;s labeled as neutral, but 
it just so happens that it compels religious believers to 
violate their sincerely held religious beliefs, that&#x27;s okay 
under the First Amendment. Is that correct? Is it your 
understanding of the law as it currently exists?
    Justice Robinson. No, Senator Hawley, I&#x27;m not aware that 
the U.S. Supreme Court has addressed the nuance of a free 
exercise claim coupled with a free speech claim, which is what 
you just described. What I referenced earlier was a straight-up 
free exercise claim, and I think that the U.S. Supreme Court 
hasn&#x27;t backed away from Justice Scalia&#x27;s decision in the Smith 
case in terms of the applicable law.
    Senator Hawley. You stand by your representation of this 
client and all of the arguments that she made, including 
calling the position of these two Catholics, Malcolm and Susan 
Baker, invidious, pernicious, and akin to racial 
discrimination? Do you regret any of that rhetoric?
    Justice Robinson. Senator, I don&#x27;t remember the context. I 
haven&#x27;t looked at that brief in 30 years.
    Senator Hawley. Does the passage of time make it any 
different? I&#x27;ll give this to you for the record, and that will 
allow you to refresh your memory, but I just--I&#x27;m quoting you, 
``Invidious, pernicious, akin to racial discrimination.&#x27;&#x27; As 
you sit here, does that not trouble you that you&#x27;re describing 
the religious beliefs of practicing Catholics who are citing 
the teachings of their church? You think that&#x27;s akin to the Ku 
Klux Klan?
    Justice Robinson. Senator, the threshold question in the 
case, which I suspect I will find is what we were addressing in 
that passage, was whether or not this was discrimination 
against my client on the basis of her religion.
    Senator Hawley. You are saying that these two Catholics, 
who did not want to provide the speech you engage in the speech 
your client wanted to them to on the basis of their faith, 
doing so was akin to religious discrimination.
    Listen, I have to tell you, the last President sent 
somebody up here to this Committee who made that exact 
argument, a Republican who made that exact argument, I voted 
no. That person didn&#x27;t get confirmed. I&#x27;ve got profound, 
profound concerns, Justice Robinson, about your position here. 
I have to tell you the passage of time doesn&#x27;t do anything to 
alleviate my concerns.
    One more question, Mr. Chairman, if I might. Let&#x27;s shift to 
criminal law. The Kuzawski case. Can you help me understand 
this case? September term, 2017. This is a defendant who was 
living with his girlfriend and her six-year-old daughter. The 
defendant was using box cutters to open boxes. The six-year-old 
asks him what he was doing. The defendant held a box cutter to 
the girl&#x27;s stomach, told her he would kill her in her sleep, 
then laughed as the girl ran away. The girl later told her 
father about the incident, said she was unable to sleep, 
understandably.
    This same defendant later convicted of aggravated domestic 
assault with a deadly weapon. You dissented, saying he 
shouldn&#x27;t have been convicted. You wrote, ``In part because the 
blade was covered with plastic, it shouldn&#x27;t have been 
considered a real threat,&#x27;&#x27; and you went so far as to analogize 
this to a pillow fight. I&#x27;ve got the case right here. You said, 
``This threat, in this case, is akin to the threat to use a 
pillow to swat somebody&#x27;s backside.&#x27;&#x27;
    I have to tell you, this completely baffles me. The threat 
of a box cutter to a 6-year-old&#x27;s stomach, and the guy says 
he&#x27;s going to kill her? That&#x27;s akin to swatting her with a 
pillow? What am I missing here?
    Justice Robinson. Thank you, Senator. I think if the 
picture in your mind is the box cutter that we use to open 
boxes in our garage, I would understand your perception that--
--
    Senator Hawley. The picture is the one that is in the 
record because it&#x27;s in the case. I can see it. It&#x27;s right here. 
It&#x27;s right here. It&#x27;s a box cutter. There&#x27;s a blade. [Picture 
was shown]
    Justice Robinson. Yes.
    Senator Hawley. He put that to her stomach.
    Justice Robinson. The blade was completely covered, 
Senator. The question of law----
    Senator Hawley. He threatened to kill her.
    Justice Robinson. The question of law--well, there were two 
questions. One was the record, and what the record showed, and 
I understand your description of what you understand the record 
to have showed, I&#x27;d have to go back and look more broadly. The 
legal question is whether the definition of deadly weapon in 
Vermont law was satisfied by that implement. The fact that an 
implement may be used in a deadly way doesn&#x27;t make it, by 
definition, a deadly weapon. The question involved the very 
specific nature of that box cutter and the way he used it.
    Senator Hawley. Well, all I can say is I find your position 
in this case frightening. The idea, as the father of three 
young children, the idea that somebody puts a box cutter to a 
young girl&#x27;s stomach and says he&#x27;s going to kill her in her 
sleep, and that that&#x27;s not an issue, frankly, I think that&#x27;s 
crazy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Blumenthal [presiding]. Senator Durbin has gone to 
vote, I will go shortly, but that concludes our first panel. We 
thank both of you for your excellent testimony this morning, 
and congratulations, again, to you and your families. We will 
now move to the next panel. Please be mindful that Senators may 
submit written questions following the hearing, and we&#x27;ll ask 
you to work diligently to respond to them. Thank you very much.
    Justice Robinson. Thank you, Senator Blumenthal, and thank 
all of you.
    Senator Blumenthal. With that, we&#x27;ll move to our second 
panel. I&#x27;ll ask for everyone&#x27;s patience for a moment while we 
finalize the set-up for these two nominees.
    Dr. Gupta and Ms. Prelogar, you may take your seats. I&#x27;m 
going to ask you to stand and take the oath as is our custom.
    [Witnesses are sworn in.]
    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you, Dr. Gupta. You may proceed 
with your opening statement.

              STATEMENT OF RAHUL GUPTA, NOMINEE TO

          BE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY

    Dr. Gupta. Good afternoon, Chairman Durbin, and Chairman 
Blumenthal, at this point. Thank you, Member Grassley, 
distinguished Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting 
me to discuss my nomination for Director of National Drug 
Control Policy with you.
    I would like to thank my home State Senators who were 
earlier here today, Senator Manchin and Senator Capito, for 
their kind introductions. I&#x27;m honored that President Biden has 
nominated me for this position. I would like to thank my family 
for their steadfast support. I&#x27;m grateful to my wife of 25 
years, Dr. Seema Gupta, who serves our Nation&#x27;s veterans as a 
physician, and my twin sons, Arka and Drew, who have taken time 
from their studies to be here.
    I&#x27;m also happy to have my dear friends, Reverend John 
Unger, who has worked with Mother Theresa in Calcutta, India, 
and Brian Skinner with me. I&#x27;m eternally grateful to my late 
parents without whose blessings I would not be here today.
    It&#x27;s a privilege to appear before you as the President&#x27;s 
nominee, and also as a practicing physician, a first-generation 
immigrant, and a public health official from a rural State. 
With decades of experience at the intersection of public health 
and public safety, I am ready and eager to lead the Federal 
Government&#x27;s response to addiction and the overdose epidemic. 
With your support, I hope to get to work as soon as possible.
    As you are aware, this epidemic has cost hundreds of 
thousands of American lives. Fueled by illicitly manufactured 
fentanyl, methamphetamine, and cocaine, this urgent challenge 
has grown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, there are more 
than 21 million Americans with a substance use disorder, yet 
only a fraction of physicians who have the qualifications to 
treat them. It&#x27;s no surprise that so many people do not know 
where to turn for help.
    As a physician I&#x27;ve taken the Hippocratic Oath. I&#x27;ve served 
in towns as small as 1,900 residents, and in cities as large as 
25 million. As I&#x27;ve seen the challenges people, providers, and 
local communities face as a public health official, both at 
county and State levels, my record reflects my commitment to 
addressing the differing needs of diverse populations.
    As West Virginia&#x27;s Health Commissioner, I launched the 
first statewide social autopsy, a review of the lives of all 
West Virginians who died of drug overdose in 2016, and many of 
those findings were just stunning. Four out of every five 
victims had a contact with a healthcare system prior to their 
death, and our system of care had failed to provide them timely 
help they needed. We used this data to change our approach. We 
expanded access to Naloxone to prevent fatal overdoses, we 
scaled effective programs to serve families, and we partnered 
with the Department of Corrections to provide treatment to 
justice-involved individuals to reduce recidivism and help 
people transition back into society.
    I also work with the Appalachia HIDTA to bring the OD map 
program to the State, which enabled law enforcement and public 
health officials to collaborate and track overdoses across 
jurisdictions in real-time and respond. These partnerships have 
been critical in my public health work, and I look forward to 
continuing ONDCP&#x27;s strong relationship with State, local, and 
Tribal law enforcement agencies.
    Over the decades, I&#x27;ve learned that an overdose is a cry 
for help, and for far too many people, that cry goes 
unanswered. If confirmed, I would do everything in my power to 
make sure these cries are heard, and people receive the help 
that they need. My immediate focus would be to reduce and 
eventually eliminate overdose deaths. We must build a better 
addiction infrastructure centered on individuals, families, and 
bringing communities together, from public health to law 
enforcement to faith-based organizations and the private 
sector, so we can meet the people where they are and save 
lives.
    We must also reduce the supply of illicit substances 
entering our country, including illicitly manufactured fentanyl 
from Mexico and China, methamphetamine from Mexico, and cocaine 
from Colombia, and hold the drug traffickers accountable. While 
the Biden-Harris administration&#x27;s drug policy priorities have 
set us on the right path, we have much more to accomplish.
    The challenge we face is enormous. My life&#x27;s work with 
patients and communities has prepared me for this challenge, 
and I would be honored to be the first physician to lead this 
Office. If confirmed, I look forward to working with this 
Committee and Congress in a results-oriented, data-driven 
manner to turn the corner on this devastating epidemic. Thank 
you for your consideration, and I&#x27;m happy to answer your 
questions.
    Chair Durbin [presiding]. Thank you, Dr. Gupta. Before we 
proceed, let me thank Senator Blumenthal, who has hurried off 
to vote. We do a tag-team here when the votes are on to try to 
keep the Committee in session because you&#x27;ve all waited 
patiently for this opportunity. Thank you for your testimony. 
Ms. Prelogar, please proceed with your opening statement.

            STATEMENT OF ELIZABETH PRELOGAR, NOMINEE

          TO BE SOLICITOR GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES

    Ms. Prelogar. Thank you, Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member 
Grassley, and Members of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. Chairman, 
thank you in particular for that kind introduction earlier.
    Sitting before you today, I am overwhelmed by a sense of 
gratitude. I want to thank President Biden for the incredible 
honor of this nomination, and Attorney General Garland for his 
strong support. If I am confirmed, I will work every day to 
demonstrate that I am worthy of their confidence and yours.
    I want to thank my family, whose love and support mean 
everything to me. My husband, Brandon Prelogar, is the best 
imaginable spouse, friend, and father to our children. Despite 
having a busy career in humanitarian protection, Brandon has 
always made time to support me, including being an equal 
partner at home so that I could pursue my career in public 
service. We have two wonderful sons. Blaze, who is 10 years 
old, and Beckett, who&#x27;s 8. They&#x27;re both here today. I promised 
them that we would go out for milkshakes after this to reward 
good behavior, so actually, the whole family has a lot riding 
on this hearing.
    My incredible mother, Jeanne Barchas is here, as well. 
There are no words to express how grateful I am to her for 
shaping my values and work ethic and always demonstrating the 
importance of service. I wouldn&#x27;t be here today without the 
example she set, the encouragement she provided to always 
pursue my dreams, and the unending support she has given me to 
help me reach them.
    My brother, Eric Barchas, is here also. Pretty much from 
the day I was born he has been my best friend. I finally want 
to thank all of the additional family and friends who have 
supported me, including many who, I think, are probably glued 
to C-SPAN right now. My mother- and father-in-law in Kansas, 
Mick and Bill Prelogar, my sister Leah, and my nephew Taylor.
    I wish my father, Rudy Barchas, had lived to see this day. 
He was an attorney, too. He loved the law and took great joy in 
watching my legal career unfold. I think about my dad every 
day, and I know how much he would&#x27;ve enjoyed this moment.
    One other person who&#x27;s very much on my mind today is 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who I had the privilege to clerk 
for after law school. Justice Ginsburg was so much to so many, 
rightly an inspiration for the entire Nation. To me, she was a 
teacher, a mentor, a justice-seeker, and the epitome of 
unrelenting grace. Justice Ginsburg is the person who moved my 
admission to join the Supreme Court Bar, and I have to think 
that she would&#x27;ve thought there was no better use for that bar 
admission than to serve in the position for which I&#x27;ve been 
nominated as Solicitor General of the United States.
    When I returned to the Solicitor General&#x27;s Office in 
January, it felt like coming home. I worked in the Office for 
several years across administrations as a career attorney, and 
more recently, as the Acting Solicitor General. There is so 
much that I love about the Office, and I can say from that up-
close view, there&#x27;s no better place to work. I love the intense 
commitment to integrity and professionalism, a recognition that 
we must turn square corners in our filings with fidelity to the 
rule of law and the role of the court in our constitutional 
structure.
    I love the unparalleled intellectual rigor in our work. We 
probe our arguments, pressure test our theory of the case, and 
seek to perfect our presentation in setting forth our 
understanding of the law. I love the exhilaration of standing 
up in the highest court in the Nation, when it&#x27;s considering 
the most important legal issues of our time, to present 
arguments on behalf of a client who I am deeply honored to 
represent, the United States of America.
    I am humbled by and filled with joy at this opportunity to 
lead the Office of the Solicitor General. If I am confirmed, I 
will work as hard as I can every day to honor the traditions of 
the Office, to carry out the responsibilities of this position 
with integrity, and to serve my country by always seeking to 
protect and defend the interests of the United States. Thank 
you for your consideration. I look forward to answering your 
questions.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Ms. Prelogar. As I introduced you, 
I certainly am convinced of your qualifications for this and 
don&#x27;t feel any less after your opening statement.
    Dr. Gupta, thank you, not just for aspiring to this 
important position, but for your life&#x27;s work. As we said in our 
telephone conversation, I was struck by the fact that you 
didn&#x27;t head to the bright lights in your life. You headed to 
the communities that needed your help, and many times chose 
rural areas in parts of this country that others might not have 
chosen in your determination to deal with the drug crisis we 
currently face and one we have faced over the years.
    There are two things that I want to make a comment on and 
ask your reaction to. One, there are many people to blame for 
the opioid epidemic, and I am not taking away any of the 
responsibility that they had, but there are two areas that, I 
think, have been overlooked. Despite the growing evidence of 
the addictive nature of opioids, many people in your 
profession, the medical profession, continue to prescribe these 
in vast quantities. Some of them were clearly with criminal 
intent, but others seem to be with indifference to whether or 
not the person became addicted to the product when a 
conscientious doctor following that patient would&#x27;ve realized 
it over some period of time.
    The drug salesmen, whatever other influences were involved 
in that, push many of these doctors to continue to prescribe 
opioids in indefensible amounts, even after we knew that they 
were addictive. I&#x27;d like your comment on that.
    Then the second one, I mentioned to you. It was in this 
room six or seven years ago, where I discovered the role of the 
Drug Enforcement Agency, which has to approve the annual quota 
of production for opioid products. They were authorizing, at 
pharma&#x27;s request, let me underline that, at pharma&#x27;s request, 
amounts of those drugs to be produced each year way beyond any 
of the needs of medical practice. They were clearly setting 
them up to be part of an illegal and sometimes criminal 
undertaking in selling these drugs in quantities. Tell me what 
you think about those two elements and what you&#x27;re going to do 
about them.
    Dr. Gupta. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Both are very important 
questions. I have worked very closely, as you are aware, may be 
aware that West Virginia was amongst the worst hit in terms of 
shipping of hundreds of millions of opioids into the small 
State of about less than 2 million people. We have worked very 
hard across jurisdictions, across the State, as well as in a 
multidisciplinary and multifaceted manner.
    We were--I was very happy to see that our reduction in the 
supply and prescribing of opioids far exceeded many other 
jurisdictions across the United States, but it takes a lot of 
effort. There is no doubt that there are doctors who have ill-
intent in prescribing, what I call bad docs. There&#x27;s also no 
doubt that there&#x27;s a lot of other doctors who have been told or 
otherwise been--believe that it&#x27;s a good idea without having 
scientific evidence at the time. We still have more other 
physicians who have just over-prescribed.
    It&#x27;s been a problem of volume. It&#x27;s a problem of diversion, 
and I think it&#x27;s going to take us time to get there, but we 
must also make sure that as the pendulum swings, we also take 
care of the people who have legitimate pain. At the same time, 
the DEA, I agree that there is a lot of work we still need to 
do, and if I&#x27;m confirmed you have my commitment to working on 
both of those aspects.
    Chair Durbin. In our conversation, I also noted the fact 
that there&#x27;s been a dramatic change and shift in our feelings 
about addiction. Sad to say, 15 or 20 years ago, if you said 
that ``someone overdosed last night, who do you think they are, 
and where do they live?&#x27;&#x27; You&#x27;d say, ``I&#x27;m going to guess 
African American, 30 years old, inner-city?&#x27;&#x27; You would&#x27;ve been 
right.
    Not so anymore with opioids, and heroin, and fentanyl, and 
things that are being used now more frequently. Those have 
affected that white cheerleader girl in the suburbs, and it&#x27;s 
her family that comes forward, heartbroken, and learns that she 
is overdosed and dead as a result of it. I think it&#x27;s forced us 
to really throw out the stereotypes and look at addiction as a 
medical problem, not just a failure of moral purpose, but a 
medical problem. Do you sense that change in conversation, as 
well?
    Dr. Gupta. Yes. Mr. Chairman, I hope my being here today as 
a nominee reflects both the presence--focus on this as a public 
health crisis, which it truly is, which is going to require a 
lot more than just one aspect. We have to take all of the tools 
in our toolbox to act what is clearly a public health crisis.
    Chair Durbin. I can&#x27;t think of a better introduction than 
to have those two Senators from West Virginia and their glowing 
praise of your work. I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re taking on this job. Ms. 
Prelogar, it&#x27;s no reflection on you that I directed my 
questions to Dr. Gupta. I&#x27;m for you all the way. Senator 
Grassley.
    Senator Grassley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Congratulations 
to both of you on your nomination. We start with Ms. Prelogar. 
While you were Acting Solicitor General, a Bloomberg Law 
article noted that the Biden administration, quote, ``is on 
track to reverse the Government&#x27;s position in more cases before 
the Supreme Court than the Justice Department did during the 
first full High Court term of Donald Trump&#x27;s presidency,&#x27;&#x27; end 
of quote. Such flip-flopping impacts the credibility of the 
Solicitor General. If you plan to continue with this practice, 
are you worried about the Office losing any credibility?
    Ms. Prelogar. Thank you for that question, Ranking Member 
Grassley. Let me just say at the outset, that I think that 
consistency and stability are really important values for the 
Solicitor General&#x27;s Office. I don&#x27;t think that changes of 
position should be undertaken lightly. I certainly, in the time 
when I was the acting Solicitor General, did not make any of 
those decisions lightly. I recognize, as your question 
suggested, that any time we change position, it&#x27;s an investment 
of the Office&#x27;s credibility.
    The factors that I looked at when I made those decisions 
focused on two things. First, what are the interests of the 
United States? Second, what is our best understanding of the 
law? We have a very well-established process in the Solicitor 
General&#x27;s Office of soliciting views far and wide to form 
judgments about those.
    Luckily, I did not have to sit there on my own and try to 
figure it out. We go to every Federal agency that has an equity 
in the subject matter. We solicit recommendations from the 
litigating components at the Department, whether that&#x27;s civil, 
or civil rights, or tax, or criminal. We also go to career 
officials in the Office of the Solicitor General. There&#x27;s 
always an Assistant to the Solicitor General and a Deputy 
Solicitor General who weigh in. I was one of those for many 
years, one of the Assistants in a career spot in the Office.
    I have a very healthy respect for that process, and only 
after that kind of extensive deliberation did I make in any of 
those situations the decision to change position. In the vast 
majority of cases, we stayed the course with our prior 
position, but in the limited number of cases where I determined 
it was necessary, those were the factors that I looked at and 
the process that I ran.
    Senator Grassley. My last question to you would be you were 
heavily involved in the Special Counsel&#x27;s investigation, an 
investigation that demands transparency and accountability. I 
have two questions. Do you know that Federal criminal cases are 
routinely dismissed because law enforcement officials withhold 
evidence?
    Ms. Prelogar. Yes, Senator. I believe that that refers to 
the Brady doctrine, as a general matter, and the ability--or 
the requirement to turn over evidence, including exculpatory 
evidence to the accused in a criminal case.
    Senator Grassley. You were a significant member of the 
Special Counsel team. Please explain to me why the cell phone 
given to you for the duration of the investigation only 
contained 215 personal photos, and why that should not qualify 
as withholding evidence.
    Ms. Prelogar. I&#x27;m sorry, Senator. Are you speaking about 
the phone that I was given as part of the Special--why it had 
250 photos?
    Senator Grassley. Yes.
    Ms. Prelogar. I did not remember the number of photos 
sitting here today, I bet most of those were cute shots of my 
kids. I think probably the answer to that is that I had a 
personal cell phone at the time, and I tried mostly to use the 
photos on my Special Counsel device just for work purposes, but 
I guess sometimes--I&#x27;m surprised there were that many, 
actually. It must have been the case the kids were doing 
something cute, so I whipped it out.
    Senator Grassley. One question for Dr. Gupta, and thank you 
for the time you spent in my office yesterday. Your agency is 
tasked with making and coordinating our nationwide drug control 
strategy. The agency released a statement of drug policy 
priorities earlier this year, but a number of important issues 
were noticeably absent.
    At the agency&#x27;s invitation, I sent a letter outlining what, 
I think, should be included in the national drug control 
strategy. This includes permanently scheduling fentanyl-related 
substances, dealing with an increased methamphetamine threat, 
and addressing polydrug trafficking and use. If confirmed, will 
you commit to reviewing these suggestions and considering their 
inclusion in the National Drug Control strategy?
    Dr. Gupta. Thank you, Ranking Member Grassley, and thank 
you for spending the time with me yesterday afternoon, as well. 
If confirmed, I do commit to having in the President&#x27;s 
inaugural drug policy these aspects included in a robust 
manner.
    Senator Grassley. Thank you very much.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Cotton.
    Senator Cotton. Ms. Prelogar, I want to continue down 
Senator Grassley&#x27;s line of questioning about position changes 
at the Solicitor General&#x27;s Office while you were the Acting 
Solicitor General. I want to speak about a specific case, 
namely Terry v. The United States. This concerned a crack 
cocaine sentencing reduction.
    The United States had been defending this sentence, which 
is typical in criminal cases, even if it&#x27;s a close call, even 
if the Government thinks the case may be overturned, but in 
March, while you were the Acting Solicitor General, you waited 
until the very last moment, in fact, the very day the brief was 
due, and sent a letter to the Court, saying the Department had 
changed its mind following the change of administration.
    Not only that you wouldn&#x27;t defend the sentence, but you 
confessed error, saying the Department had been wrong all 
along. This required the Court to reschedule oral arguments. In 
fact, this is what the Court said in its opinion. ``On the day 
the Government&#x27;s brief was due, the United States informed the 
Court that after the change in administration it would no 
longer defend the judgment. Because of the timeline, the Court 
rescheduled argument, compressed the briefing schedule, and 
appointed Adam Mortara as amicus curiae to argue in support of 
the judgment. He has ably discharged his responsibilities.&#x27;&#x27;
    I haven&#x27;t practiced law for a long time, but that sounds to 
me like a Court that is somewhat displeased the Government 
switched its position at the very last moment in a way that 
caused them to reschedule their briefings. Here&#x27;s the thing. 
Once the Government switched its position and the case was 
argued, it wasn&#x27;t a close call. It wasn&#x27;t 5-to-4 with some 
anguished majority opinion saying that, ``Well, it&#x27;s a really 
close judgment. We understand the dissent&#x27;s point.&#x27;&#x27; The 
Government lost 9-to-0, and the only reason you lost 9-to-0 is 
there aren&#x27;t 11 Supreme Court Justices.
    The Government, in fact--or no, the Court said that the 
Government was engaged in sleight of hand. Ms. Prelogar, how 
did your Office get it so wrong? You said that you went through 
evaluating U.S. interests and what&#x27;s the best understanding of 
the law, and just weeks later, the Supreme Court ruled, not 5-
to-4, not 6-to-3, 9-to-0 that you were wrong in the Terry case. 
How did your Office get it so wrong?
    Ms. Prelogar. Thank you for that question, Senator Cotton, 
and I appreciate having the chance to talk about that case. I 
certainly found that to be a very difficult decision. In making 
the decision that we should ultimately confess error in that 
case, which is a longstanding tradition within the Solicitor 
General&#x27;s Office when we determine that that&#x27;s appropriate in 
the interests of justice, I did focus on the legal issues 
involved, and ultimately the interests of the United States.
    The question in that case is whether the lowest level crack 
cocaine offenders could be eligible for re-sentencing under the 
First Step Act. It was a given that the individuals who were 
responsible for greater quantities of crack cocaine fell within 
the provision, and so the only question was whether those 
lowest level offenders also could get that kind of sentencing 
relief, the possibility of it, under the First Step Act.
    That was a question that had divided the circuit courts. 
Circuit Judges appointed by both political parties had 
disagreed on that issue. Ultimately, after looking at all the 
tools of statutory construction, the text of the provision, the 
context of the purpose, it was my judgment that Congress had 
intended to extend that sentencing relief to the low-level 
offenders. The Court----
    Senator Cotton. Do you think--I&#x27;m sorry. Our time is 
limited here, but I mean, do you think having switched the 
Government&#x27;s position, and then being rejected 9-to-0 just a 
few weeks later by the Supreme Court, I mean, do you think you 
got that decision wrong?
    Ms. Prelogar. Senator, I certainly respect the Supreme 
Court&#x27;s decision and the fact that the Justice&#x27;s disagreed with 
our position in the case. Ultimately, I wish that we could 
persuade the Court of our position in each and every case, and 
I can&#x27;t quite bat a thousand like that. Ultimately, as Justice 
Sotomayor observed in her concurring decision in this case, the 
ball is now in Congress&#x27; court if it wants to extend that kind 
of sentencing relief to the low-level offenders.
    Senator Cotton. After having joined the majority 9-to-0 
opinion that said it was not a close call at all. That letter 
was submitted on March 15th. Are you the one who personally 
made the decision to confess error in the Terry case?
    Ms. Prelogar. I am, Senator. I was the Acting Solicitor 
General at that time, so I was responsible for all of our 
litigating positions on merits cases in the Supreme Court.
    Senator Cotton. Did any higher-ranking official in the 
Department of Justice direct you to make that switch?
    Ms. Prelogar. No, Senator.
    Senator Cotton. Did you consult with any higher-ranking 
official in the Department of Justice?
    Ms. Prelogar. I don&#x27;t think it would be appropriate for me 
to discuss internal deliberations at the Department of Justice. 
I can tell you as a general matter that the Solicitor General&#x27;s 
Office solicits viewpoints and perspectives from all interested 
components that can include the leadership offices. It can 
include the Federal agencies, and of course, the litigating 
components, as well.
    Senator Cotton. You said in your response to Senator 
Grassley that one of the things you do is go to litigating 
components and agencies with equities. The Acting Attorney 
General for the Office of Legal Counsel, when he testified in 
front of this Committee a few months ago, said he was not 
consulted in this case.
    When--would it be the Solicitor General&#x27;s normal practice 
to go to the Office of Legal Counsel on a question like this 
when you&#x27;re thinking about switching a legal position?
    Ms. Prelogar. As a general matter, no. When a matter is in 
active litigation, the litigating components handle that rather 
than the Office of Legal Counsel.
    Senator Cotton. All right, well, my time has expired. As 
Senator Grassley said, this is part of a pattern. This is just 
the most egregious case since the Government switched from its 
previous position and then lost 9-to-0 at the Supreme Court. I 
can keep going if the Chairman wants me to.
    Chair Durbin. Pardon me.
    Senator Cotton. I can keep going if he doesn&#x27;t have anyone 
else to ask questions.
    Chair Durbin. We certainly enjoy your questions, thank you, 
Senator. Senator Cruz has said he is returning, but do we have 
any indication of where he is? Senator Cotton, you see my 
dilemma. The witnesses are here, and the Senator is not, and I 
want to accommodate him if I can.
    Senator Klobuchar. I was, but it was going to go----
    Chair Durbin. I&#x27;m sorry?
    Senator Klobuchar. Oh, just Senator Klobuchar, just trying 
to ask questions.
    Chair Durbin. There we go. Senator Klobuchar, virtually. 
Virtuously and virtually.
    Senator Klobuchar. I will try to be very quick, given that 
I know we&#x27;re trying to wind up. I wanted to thank all of our 
nominees. Dr. Gupta, we talked yesterday. Your nomination is 
supported by both Senator Manchin and Capito, as well as West 
Virginia&#x27;s Republican Governor, who said this: ``I believe that 
there is no one better suited to this important job than 
someone who represented a State and a people where the opioid 
crisis really hits close to home.&#x27;&#x27; In your view, how has this 
support from across the political spectrum going to help you in 
this job?
    Dr. Gupta. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. It was indeed a 
pleasure to speak with you. I believe that it&#x27;s important when 
we&#x27;re dealing with the epidemic that has claimed 95,000 lives 
predicted as of January, for 12 months period, January of this 
year, that we work in a manner that helps to address the public 
health crisis that is. This will--it&#x27;s a complex and difficult 
situation and Americans need our help.
    It&#x27;s going to involve entire village to help, to be honest, 
and I think it&#x27;s going to be important whether we&#x27;re looking at 
supply side issues or demand-side issues, we&#x27;re going to need 
to have a lot more effort moving forward. The President&#x27;s 
budget proposes significant and historic funding levels to 
support that work, and I believe that the support that has been 
demonstrated of my record reflects my ability to work across 
lines and across communities and stakeholders.
    Senator Klobuchar. Then one last question here. In a 2018 
editorial of the Marshall Journal of Medicine, you discussed 
how overincarceration addiction-related issues complicated some 
of the issues about responding to the epidemic. I&#x27;ve been a 
longtime supporter of drug courts from my time as a prosecutor. 
I grew up as the daughter of an alcoholic. I&#x27;m well aware of 
how treatment can literally change someone&#x27;s life. Just 
briefly, if you could address drug courts and how you will 
champion them, I hope, on both the State and Federal level in 
this job.
    Dr. Gupta. Thank you, Senator. I have worked very closely 
with the State drug courts and systems. There is clear evidence 
to demonstrate that the 4,000 treatment courts across our 
Nation that are looking at about 150,000 Americans to help have 
demonstrated clear benefit. That includes both reducing crime, 
but also saving almost $6,000 a person. It also has a 
disproportionate impact benefit in employment, schooling, and 
other societal and community impacts. I hope that we can 
continue to advance that part of the solution for this 
particular epidemic.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you. I will not put my questions 
for you, Ms. Prelogar on the record, but congratulations on 
receiving letters of support from several former Solicitor 
Generals, including every Solicitor General who served in 
Republican administration over the last three decades. That is 
very impressive. With that, thank you very much, Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. The letters on 
support of all four of the witnesses this morning will be 
placed in the record without objection.
    Questions for the record are due to the nominees by 5 p.m. 
on Tuesday September 21st. The record will remain open until 
that time to submit letters and similar materials. Thank you to 
the witnesses for your patience today, and with that the 
hearing stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 12:42 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
    [Additional material submitted for the record follows.]
